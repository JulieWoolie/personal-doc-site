they lay. Their robes torn by iron blades. Screams erupt from them as the
final realization sets in: There is no god, they were created by nothing and
for no one.</p><p>For a millennia they shall scream in longing for a god that does not exist, for
a god that will not hold or cradle them. Like chicks crying out for a mother
that will not return to the nest, screaming and crying.</p><p>What peace lay there for the humans below the soft clouds. They are alone in
this cruel universe. They have no god or gods or protectors or guardians. They
are left alone in this universe with no purpose other than their immediate
desires.</p><p>Arcadia lay in ruins, it's vast forests and ecosystems set alight by reality.
Azrael soars, finally free to reap souls, while Uriel sobs into his melting
hands, primordial divinity undone.</p><h2>Concrete</h2><p big-letter>Long columns of concrete shoot out from the floor into the ceilling, where
they intersect with the overhead beams of concrete. A structure that will
hold, serve its purpose. Vast, but unseemly. The concrete is cold and sterile,
to touch is to feel its bite on you. For a thousand miles it stretches on in
a thousand different directions: endless</p><p>Attempts at warmth do nothing but paint the obscene in vivid colors: The
columns white and red while the overhead beams are painted a vibrant blue. The
paint is already peeling even though the uncaring monstrosity that erected
this insult to human warmth constructed this only a few moons ago.</p><p>My eyes dart between the columns, looking for a single other. I am alone in
the cold. Why walk, I know I shall meet none other. So I sit, the cold
loneliness I will one day grow accustomed to. Surely one day I shall learn to
accept its bite, the marks of its teeth upon my body will one day bring
comfort.</p><p>If this maze ever crumbles and I find another, will I miss the cold teeth of
this brutal concrete, will I struggle to embrace the other. Will the touch of
another scare me then as the touch of the cold concrete scares me now?</p><h2>I decay</h2><p big-letter>I've never completed myself. I've never possessed all the parts to make myself
whole. Limbs have fallen off, decayed. Some I've ripped off because I hated
them, some I tore off because I heard the voice telling me to rip it off. It
told me the parts were obscene, they were past their use date. I saw those
limbs, I looked at them, I saw there to be no issue with them, but still I
reached, and with wet squelches and the cracking of bone and the awful tearing
of skin I felt the arm come loose.</p><p no-indent>I screamed each time I felt it hit the ground.</p><p no-indent>I screamed not from the pain of removal, but from the knowledge I'd lost
another part of myself, another limb with which I was closer to being whole
lost.</p><p no-indent>Will I ever be whole? Or rather, will I ever feel whole?</p><p no-indent>What point is there in tearing my own limbs, hands, legs, eyes from myself? I
never know, the voice does not spare me the curtesy of explanation, it simply
demands and explains in demented tongue the benefits.</p></article><script src=/js/images.js></script></main><div class="bg-dark content-sizing footer" style=margin-top:2cm><div class=footer-flex><button class=button id=latex-convert-btn>Copy content as LaTeX</button>
