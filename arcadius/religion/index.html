between several gods, and you pray to the god that's relevant to what
you're struggling with.</p><p>For example, if you need luck on a journey over sea, you'd pray to the
sea god or goddess.</p><h2>Gods</h2><p><b><i>Note</i></b>: The names used in this list are meant to be faction
independent. Faction specific names are listed below.</p><h3>Main Gods</h3><dl><dt>Imperator Divius</dt><dd>The First Emperor, ascended to godhood after death, the hero-god of
humanity.<p><i>"Imperator"</i> meaning Emperor, of course, but <i>"Divius"</i> means
god, but in Latin, there is a difference between a god that has always
been a god, and a man that became god. <i>"Deus"</i> is the word for a
god that has always been a god, <i>"Divius"</i> is the word for a man
that became god.</p></dd><dt>Deus Mare</dt><dd>God of travelling and of the sea.<p><i>"Mare"</i>, which is the latin for <i>"Sea"</i>.</p></dd><dt>Deus Bellum</dt><dd>God of war, bloodshed, combat, struggle.<p><i>"Bellum"</i> meaning "War".</p></dd><dt>Deus Fodina</dt><dd>God of work, resourcefulness, miners and builders.<p><i>"Fodina"</i>, latin for <i>"Mine"</i> (As in a place for digging).</p></dd></dl><h3>Less Important Gods</h3><dl><dt>Deus Amor</dt><dd>Goddess of Love, mercy, forgiveness and compassion.<p><i>"Amor"</i>, latin for <i>"Love"</i>.</p></dd><dt>Carceres</dt><dd>God of the Dungeons<p><i>"Carceres"</i>, latin for <i>"Dungeons"</i>.</p></dd></dl><h2>Names of the Gods and Goddesses</h2><p>Each faction (Latins, Pirates, Vikings, and Dungeon Dwellers) hold their
own name for the gods, with some overlapping.</p><p>Most importantly, each faction has a separate name for the hero-god of
humanity, as each believes themselves to be descended from the first
emperor's faction, or lineage. It is important to note that there is no
way of confirming if the emperor belonged to any faction or if they
ever has children.</p><p>It is widely considered that <i>"Divine Bloodline"</i> (Descendants of
the first emperor) has died out.</p><h3>Table of Names</h3><p>The following is a table of names of gods and the names each faction
gives them</p><table><thead><tr><th>Name</th><th>Latins</th><th>Pirates</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Imperator Divius</td><td>Adis</td><td>---</td></tr><tr><td>Deus Mare</td><td>Judius</td><td>---</td></tr><tr><td>Deus Bellum</td><td>Mars</td><td>---</td></tr><tr><td>Deus Romance</td><td>Juno</td><td>---</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Religious Structure</h2><p>The organization of the religion itself depends on the faction in
question, with some factions having more organized and power religious
institutions than others. The religious organization of a faction is
meant to mirror that faction's attitude towards freedom. Less organized
factions are more loose, more free.</p><h3>Latins</h3><p>The Latins have the most organized and institutionally powerful church
out of all factions. <i>Latium</i><note idx=0></note>,
itself featuring several temples and religious statues.</p><p>Additionally, <i>Latium</i>, is be the home of the <i>"Temple Maximus"</i>,
or <i>"The Great Temple"</i>, a grand temple featuring all the gods of
the pantheon. But more importantly, it is also the seat of the
<i>Pontifex Maximus</i>, the chief priest.</p><p>Each god that's worshipped in <i>Latium</i> has its own temple, and a
<i>Pontifex</i> that represents all temples of that god in the
<i>College of Pontifs</i><note idx=1></note>. This college itself,
was headed by a <i>Pontifex Maximus</i> that represented the college.</p><p>Worship is often performed by offering sacrifices at temples to the
gods. The type of animal offered is what determines the god being prayed
to.</p><h3>Pirates</h3><p>The religious structure of the Pirates, when compared to the Latins, is
almost non existent. Worship is shown by giving offerings, commonly in
the form of money, to a shaman or priest. Offerings are given before
travels, battles or celebrations.</p><p>Note the lack of any Colleges, or any institutional form of religious
organization. It's more lax, loose and free. This is reflective of the
pirate's free and loose culture.</p><h2>Creation Legend</h2><p>The Creation Legend is lore that is mostly intended to be unknown to the
residents of the world of Arcadius. This section will summarize the
creation legend of Arcadia.</p><p>In the beginning, there was Kaos, a primordial being made up of nothing.
Kaos created the next 2 gods, Uwmus and Juhuna. The gods, created
Econia, a plane of heavenly forests, seas and nature. They created
the next generation of Divines, giving birth to <i>Deus Amor</i> and
<i>Deus Mare</i>.</p><p>Those now roaming the planes of Econia, were not <i>"Gods"</i>, but
rather Divines, beings that lived unending lives, but were relatively
powerless. Only some, born with powers were granted the title of
<i>"God"</i>. But make no mistake, Divines can die, just not from old
age.</p><p>With the Divines roaming the plane of Econia, they began to enter
competitions of strength against each other. The anger, drive, passion
and bloodshed of these competitions quickly created <i>Deus Bellum</i>,
the god of war, combat and struggle.</p><p>Kaos, Uwmus, Juhuna and the others, seeing Divines bludgeon and kill other
Divines in these competitions, needed the gods to divert their anger
somewhere else. As a result, they met and created <i>Carceres</i>, a god
whom they assigned the task of creating a battleground, an arena, or
anything in which the Divines could compete.</p><p>The Result of Carceres' work was the Dungeons. In creating the Dungeons,
Carceres lost themself in it, and became part of the living organism
that now makes up the Dungeons.</p><p>The Divines, excited by this new battleground, entered in droves to fight
and battle. But in Carceres' realm they found not a battlefield, but an
ever shifting maze of ruins, fortresses and temples. Littered with
beings no one had ever seen before. Most rooms contained weak husks,
imitations of the Divines' own forms, some without skin, some with
decaying skin.</p><p>It became a massacre. Thousands of Divines, and even Gods being slain.
Kaos, Juhuna and Uwmus were furious with Carceres, who had created a
nightmare for the Divines. But they were unable, or unwilling, to enter
his realm, retrieve and punish him. They weren't sure Carceres
even existed anymore.</p><p>As it took the lives of the Divines, it absorbed them, fused them
together and created from them even stronger beasts. The stronger
beasts becoming Guardians of the fortresses, gates, temples and hordes
of Carceres' realm.</p><p>The slaughter the Gods could live with, as tragic as it was. What made
the situation untenable was when Carceres' realm began growing. Its
gates burst as the very structure itself began consuming Econia.</p><p>Kaos, Uwmus and Juhuna met and decided to seal the forsaken realm of
Econia, and the beast consuming it away. They banded together
with the remaining Gods and Divines.</p><p>They took the vat plane of Econia and wrapped it around the Carceres'
growing monstrosity. They smothered it in earth, rock soil and magma,
the beast screamed in agony but it gave way, its expansion stopping and
new realm being left, now wrapped around the Dungeon.</p><p>The Gods, created a paradise for themselves, named Arcadia. A lush
garden of palaces, forests all situated on floating islands.</p><p>Below Arcadia, where the remnants of Econia lay, wrapped around the
Dungeons, they created the Terra, the earth. To Terra, they banished the
Divines. The gods forced the Divines to forget all they knew, they
removed very essence of their immortality, condemning them to mortal
lives.</p><hr latex-ignore class=notes-hr><h2 latex-ignore class=notesheader>Notes</h2><ol latex-ignore id=footnotes-list><li note-idx=0>Latium, is the capital city of the Latins factions, and the central city in which the server&rsquo;s spawn is located.</li><li note-idx=1>&ldquo;College&rdquo;, in this case refers to the Ancient Roman types of college, or rather Collegia, which were more similar to Medieval Guilds, than modern colleges.</li></ol></div><script src=/js/images.js></script></div><script src=/js/main.js></script>
