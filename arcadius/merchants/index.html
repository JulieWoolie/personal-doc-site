players can interact with. This sytem allows players to give large quantities
of items to merchants, who then <i>"embark"</i> on a voyage to sell the goods
overseas. All funds earned from selling are then returned to the player(s)
from whom the items came.</p><h2 no-pre-break>Purpose</h2><p>The purpose of the merchants is to provide a way for late-game, richer players
to spend their money and earn more without using farms and mass-selling.</p><h2>Concept</h2><p>Merchant NPCs set up post where they request a certain amount of stock, always
in large quantities. Players then give these NPCs stock. And after a certain
time, or after their order has been filled, the NPCs <i>embark</i> and</p><p>As will be mentioned in the later Regional Differences section</p><h2>Regional Differences</h2><p>Depending on where a player participates in trading, different outcomes are
possible.</p><h3>Latium</h3><p>For players trading in Latium, trade goods are taxed, as such, players will
never earn 100% from the goods they trade. There is a <i>minor</i> risk of the
cargo being taken by pirate's when out at sea. But these ships are protected
by the Imperial Navy, so the risk is, <i>minor</i>.</p><p>The tax rate applied to the goods varies. It is controlled by both the senate
and the current emperor.</p><h3>Calavera</h3><p>For players trading in Calavera, trading is more lucrative, as Pirates don't
pay taxes. But the risk of the shipments being seized by the Imperial Navy is
greater.</p><p>To combat this, players can pay a <i>Protection Fee</i> for armored ships to
accompany their ships and keep them safe from the imperial fleet.</p><p>In Calavera, it will also matter which merchants you trade with. This is
because some merchants will have a tendency to scam you. Take your goods,
maybe even your protection fee, and run, never to return.</p></article><script src=/js/images.js></script></main><div class="bg-dark content-sizing footer" style=margin-top:2cm><div class=footer-flex><button class=button id=latex-convert-btn>Copy content as LaTeX</button>
