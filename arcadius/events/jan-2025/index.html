player. The player is spawned at the edge of a hill, atop which lies several
targets the player must break with snow balls.</p><p>The player acquires these snow balls by wondering around the hill and dodging
Ravagers. Once enough snowballs have been gotten, the player is able to break
all targets at the top of the hill and the event ends.</p><h2>Event Arena</h2><p>As described before, the main arena of the event is a snowy hill, with
Ravagers. The hill is broken into corridors with cliffs, some connected by
arch ways. At the top of this hill is a clearing with a circular sturcture
which contains the targets the player must hit in order to end the event.</p><h2>Extras</h2><p>This section describes extra, but optional, features for the event.</p><h3>Item Shop</h3><p>A shop that accepts an event-only currency, or gems, in exchange for rare
items. One of the items, if possible, should be an Event Card, a map item that
features custom art as a keepsake for the event. This card should be a one-time
purchase.</p><h3>Money Drops</h3><p>Along side the snow balls there could also be small piles of gold litered
around the arena that players can pick up. These gold piles would obiously
reward Denarii.</p><h2>Technical Implementation</h2><p>A player's entry exists as a state machine in one of the following states:<ul><li><code>INACTIVE</code></li><li><code>STARTING</code></li><li><code>PLAY</code></li></ul>This section defines the states and how they are changed and what happens
during each state.</p><p>When a player enters the event, their event entry is set to an
<code>STARTING</code> state.</p><h3><code>STARTING</code> State</h3><dl><dt>When Entering State</dt><dd>The player is teleported into the arena, and all the Ravagers are spawned as
well. Neither the player nor the Ravagers are allowed to move at this point.
But the player is allowed to look around, but not pick up any coin stacks or
other items. Other objects such as the snowballs, coin stacks and anything
else are spawned at this point.</dd><dt>During State</dt><dd>The player is displayed a countdown each second, from 5 to 1. 1 being
replaced with <i>"Go!"</i>. After the countdown ends, the state transitions
to the next state.</dd><dt>Exiting State</dt><dd>This state always transitions to the <code>PLAY</code> State after the
countdown ends, unless the player manually exits the event, then it
transitions to the <code>INACTIVE</code> state.</dd></dl><h3><code>PLAY</code> State</h3><dl><dt>When Entering State</dt><dd>The player and all the Ravagers are allowed to move, coins can be interacted
with, and items can be picked up. The entry's starting time is set to the
current timestamp.</dd><dt>During State</dt><dd>A timer is shown on the player's screen indicating how much time they've
spent in the event. The value of the timer displayed on the screen, is
always the difference between the current time and entry's starting time.</dd><dt>Exiting State</dt><dd>Can only be done manually by the player, or when the player destroys all
targets in the middle of the arena. If all targets are destroyed, then the
event is exited in a completed way, otherwise the player simply exits.</dd></dl><h3><code>INACTIVE</code> State</h3><dl><dt>When Entering State</dt><dd>All Ravagers in the event are removed, coin stacks, removed, dropped items
removed and the center of the arena is repaired.<p>If the player exited successfully, then compare the player's current score
to their record. If the score is lower than the record, set the record to
be the score. Else do nothing.</p></dd><dt>During State</dt><dd>Nothing, State declares end of entry's participation.</dd><dt>Exiting State</dt><dd>State cannot be exited.</dd></dl></article><script src=/js/images.js></script></main><div class="bg-dark content-sizing footer" style=margin-top:2cm><div class=footer-flex><button class=button id=latex-convert-btn>Copy content as LaTeX</button>
