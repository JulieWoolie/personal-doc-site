I started finally implementing the renderer I created in the delphirender module. Starting with a very simple Flow layout that just places elements after each other. I'll implement the rest of the layout once I know the configuration and projection of entities is correct. Afterword It's 7 hours later. I hate this project... I spent almost all of today thinking about and fixing issues related to the most simple parts of rendering and layout possible.</description></item><item><title>January 2025 Event - Ravager Escape</title><link>https://juliewoolie.com/arcadius/events/jan-2025/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://juliewoolie.com/arcadius/events/jan-2025/</guid><description>General Concept The general concept of the event is to escape from many Ravagers chasing the player. The player is spawned at the edge of a hill, atop which lies several targets the player must break with snow balls. The player acquires these snow balls by wondering around the hill and dodging Ravagers. Once enough snowballs have been gotten, the player is able to break all targets at the top of the hill and the event ends.</description></item><item><title>Nightmares</title><link>https://juliewoolie.com/delphi/devjournal/05-02-2025/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://juliewoolie.com/delphi/devjournal/05-02-2025/</guid><description>Today I'll most likely be fixing yesterday's bugs, getting the Flow layout completely functional with auto margins and stuff. I started by adding support the box-sizing property to Chimera and NLayout. The offset bug I described yesterday. The blue is where the black background is intended to be located. The item element (pickaxe) is also wildly offset from where it is intended to be. Another bug to fix... On top of the previous bug, when a page is spawned, the backgrounds, outlines and anything other than content is blank, resulting in this.</description></item><item><title>NLayout Engine</title><link>https://juliewoolie.com/delphi/layout/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://juliewoolie.com/delphi/layout/</guid><description>Introduction This document describes the process of writing the NLayout engine that executes layout for Delphi and how it works. This part, the layout engine, has been the most difficult part of the Delphi project to date, executing layout with so many variables that interact in so many different ways depending on layout context and such. The layout engine is in the nlayout module, which, obviously, handles the layout execution.</description></item><item><title>Rendering Elements</title><link>https://juliewoolie.com/delphi/element-rendering/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://juliewoolie.com/delphi/element-rendering/</guid><description>Introduction This document describes the process of turning DOM elements into render objects and how those objects are rendered into display entities. The rendering is part of the delphirender module. Note: The document uses a lot of pseudo code with syntax similar to TypeScript, but breaks it occasionally for simplicity or brevity. Data Structure At the heart of the renderer is the data structure which more or less maps render objects to their DOM elements.</description></item><item><title>Visual bug fixes and support for inline data</title><link>https://juliewoolie.com/delphi/devjournal/06-02-2025/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://juliewoolie.com/delphi/devjournal/06-02-2025/</guid><description>The Day started with me testing the measurement system only to find out it worked... like as far as I could see, it worked. This was unexpected. There were some visual bugs I found, that I fixed after adjusting the BLOCK_OFFSET_X from yesterday to 0.0717 which was more accurate. And by making regular text render objects also apply the offset. (Before, only the empty text displays used the offset) The results produced by this were actually really good and fixed a visual error I encountered this morning: Before adjusting the constant.</description></item><item><title>Major rendering and layout updates</title><link>https://juliewoolie.com/delphi/devjournal/08-02-2025/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://juliewoolie.com/delphi/devjournal/08-02-2025/</guid><description>This, unlike the previous entries is being written retrospectively, so there will be missing screenshots and things. I added support for inline margins, this means implementing the margin-inline, margin-inline-start and margin-inline-end Properties. Normal margins won't be used on non-block render objects anymore, but inline margins will. After that, I mostly finished implementing the Flow layout algorithm, with the caveat that I don't know how to handle max sizes on elements without them being too large or small.</description></item><item><title>DOM Restructuring And Lots of Boring Systems</title><link>https://juliewoolie.com/delphi/devjournal/19-02-2025/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://juliewoolie.com/delphi/devjournal/19-02-2025/</guid><description>Intro Yeah, I kinda forgot about this project after I got a bit burned out. But I'm back and with some major changes to the structure of the API and the DOM tree. But before all that, little sneak peek at the dev tools I started working on: I'm just proud of how all of highlighting stuff and CSS style changing on the fly works. DOM Restructuring For context, before this, the actual part of the document represented by Delphi's API was the &amp;lt;body&amp;gt; element.</description></item><item><title>Input elements and devtools</title><link>https://juliewoolie.com/delphi/devjournal/02-03-2025/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://juliewoolie.com/delphi/devjournal/02-03-2025/</guid><description>Been a while since I wrote any updates here, apologies, real life got in the way. But alas, I've reworked some stuff and added support for &amp;lt;input/&amp;gt; elements. I had some issues implementing these elements and confusion conceptually, mentioned below. Going public I finally went "public" with this project, meaning I posted it on HangarMC and made the repository public and posted about it to the PaperMC Discord. So the project's finally open source.</description></item><item><title>Scripting support and some minor bug fixes</title><link>https://juliewoolie.com/delphi/devjournal/24-05-2025/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://juliewoolie.com/delphi/devjournal/24-05-2025/</guid><description>Oh my god, it's been awhile since I even touched this project. And here I am, I'm back to work on it... for another 2 or 3 days until I other things take my attention away from it. JS Support I've added JS support, although currently it's very basic and very unsecure. In keeping with my love of ancient greek stuff, the JS integration module has been named "Hephaestus", as the smith that's going to make these menus actually functional.</description></item><item><title>Scripting Expansions</title><link>https://juliewoolie.com/delphi/devjournal/26-05-2025/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://juliewoolie.com/delphi/devjournal/26-05-2025/</guid><description>Script expansions I added scheduling functions! setInterval(cb, delay, interval) and setTimeout(cb, delay) are now supported. But keep in mind, they take in delays and intervals in ticks, not milliseconds. Both of these functions return an ID integer that represents their task ID. There is of course an accompanying clearTimeout(taskId) to cancel both interval and timeout tasks. This was all made possible with the scheduling API I added to the DocumentView.</description></item><item><title>Canvas Elements and Trying To Get The Word Out There</title><link>https://juliewoolie.com/delphi/devjournal/09-08-2025/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://juliewoolie.com/delphi/devjournal/09-08-2025/</guid><description>Intro Alright, it's been another long while (4 months) since I posted an update about how this plugin is going. Been busy (with everything except working on the damned flexbox support). Canvas elements! Canvas elements are basically images, that you can draw whatever you want on to. I thought these would be good for people wanting to implement more complex features for their menus, and would also be cool for potential providing a basis for an &amp;lt;img&amp;gt; element in the future.</description></item><item><title>Flexbox finally!</title><link>https://juliewoolie.com/delphi/devjournal/22-08-2025/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://juliewoolie.com/delphi/devjournal/22-08-2025/</guid><description>FLEXBOX FINALLY!!! I finally got around to implementing FlexBox. It took me chugging an entire pitcher of black coffee (Don't judge me, I like doing that.) Granted, it's not fully functional, or maybe it is, I don't know, my unit tests are comprehensive enough to say yet. To accomplish this, I knew I'd need to layout algorithm in a place that didn't require me to have a server running, so I moved all the layout code into its own module, named nlayout.</description></item><item><title>The First Emperor</title><link>https://juliewoolie.com/arcadius/first-emperor/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://juliewoolie.com/arcadius/first-emperor/</guid><description>Abstract The First Emperor is an almost mythical figure that is worshipped as a god. The true identity of him has since been long forgotten, with each faction that vies over the Empire claiming their faction to be descended from the First Emperor. The real story of the emperor is unknown, even his name is contested. It is unknown if he had children or any descendants. Variations This section will summarize the variations of the Emperor's story that each faction considers true, and then will summarize the real story.</description></item><item><title>Style test</title><link>https://juliewoolie.com/style-test/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://juliewoolie.com/style-test/</guid><description>H1 Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

Quitting in the event must do the same as above. It should be impossible to enter the event with potion effects, they must be either: Cleared upon entering Prevented from entering if they possess potion effects Entering the event should function perfectly each time Exiting the event should function perfectly each time Completing the event, different from exiting, should follow the event's context and assign scores only if: The player&amp;#39;s score is higher than their record The event uses the assign-only-if-score-greater rule Alt accounts are not permitted to gain score on the same ground as main accounts, when dealing with an alt, one of the following methods must be used The alt is unable to enter (preferred) The alt is unable to gain score The alt&amp;#39;s score is given to the main The follwing are optional checks which apply on a per-event basis:</description></item><item><title>Arcadian Religion</title><link>https://juliewoolie.com/arcadius/religion/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://juliewoolie.com/arcadius/religion/</guid><description>Abstract Religion in the world of Arcadius is polytheistic, worship is split between several gods, and you pray to the god that's relevant to what you're struggling with. For example, if you need luck on a journey over sea, you'd pray to the sea god or goddess. Gods Note: The names used in this list are meant to be faction independent. Faction specific names are listed below. Main Gods Imperator Divius The First Emperor, ascended to godhood after death, the hero-god of humanity.</description></item><item><title>Design Document</title><link>https://juliewoolie.com/arcadius/dungeons/design/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://juliewoolie.com/arcadius/dungeons/design/</guid><description>Abstract The Dungeons, generally, is a rougelike feature of ArcadiusMC, similar to games like Hades, and Pressure (Roblox), with ULTRAKILL serving as inspiration as well. Players will enter the randomly-generated dungeons, fight through rooms of enemies until they find a boss room, fight the boss and then advance on to the next level. The purpose of this document is to outline the methods of implementation for the dungeons. Dungeon Structure The structures that will comprise the Dungeons' levels will be made with the "</description></item><item><title>Dungeons Design Document</title><link>https://juliewoolie.com/arcadius/dungeons/designdoc/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://juliewoolie.com/arcadius/dungeons/designdoc/</guid><description>Introduction This document will outline the way players interact with the Dungeons and how systems of the dungeons work. Setup This section describes the way the players enter and prepare for the dungeons. Players can enter the Dungeons at a Dungeon Lobby area, where they are given an option to join an existing dungeon party or create their own. Joining Parties can be joined in one of 2 ways: Be invited, or request to join.</description></item><item><title>Merchants</title><link>https://juliewoolie.com/arcadius/merchants/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://juliewoolie.com/arcadius/merchants/</guid><description>Introduction This document describes a system of merchants and tradesmen that richer players can interact with. This sytem allows players to give large quantities of items to merchants, who then "embark" on a voyage to sell the goods overseas. All funds earned from selling are then returned to the player(s) from whom the items came. Purpose The purpose of the merchants is to provide a way for late-game, richer players to spend their money and earn more without using farms and mass-selling.</description></item><item><title>The Latins Senate</title><link>https://juliewoolie.com/arcadius/senate/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://juliewoolie.com/arcadius/senate/</guid><description>Introduction This document describes the in game Arcadian Senate, how it functions, who can join it and what benefits it could have. The senate works by having members vote on motions proposed by other members. Purpose The purpose of the senate is to allow players a degree of self regulation and power over an aspect of the server's functioning. Additionally, it can serve as an influence in upcoming economic features.</description></item><item><title>Treasury</title><link>https://juliewoolie.com/arcadius/treasury/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://juliewoolie.com/arcadius/treasury/</guid><description>Introduction This document describes the imperial treasury system. A relatively simple system for storing the amount of money earned by the imperial government and its relative payout. Purpose To keep track of the economic movement of the server. And to provide payouts to the current emperor and any members of senate or any other government-affiliated organizations that may be added in the future. Concept The concept revolves around storing the amount of money paid in either taxes or rent as funding for the imperial treasury.</description></item></channel></rss>
