documentation and so forth, but, the thing is, in reality, it's just a simple
read-only file server. It's given a URL which it replies to with a file in
the repository. Other than some shortcuts to make it so
<code>index.html</code> files are served more easily, it's just a regular file
server.</p><p>This got me thinking, I could use GitHub as a Maven repo in that case, since
at it's core, a Maven repo is just a read-only file server that hosts jars and
xml files that are related to something.</p><p>Turns out, not that hard to set it up, so I did, at
<a href=https://libraries.juliewoolie.com>libraries.juliewoolie.com</a>.
Only issue as well is that most Maven repositories let you index through them.
Not a problem! I just wrote a Deno script that goes through each folder and
puts a <code>index.html</code> file in it that lists the contents of that
folder. As long as that script is ran before a commit, we're good.</p><p>And the end result is a fully functional Maven repo. As for stuff like storage
limits or rate limits or request limits or what have you, I don't know. So
far, I've not encountered any issues!</p><p>This kinda made me realise how simple hosting a website is, all you need is
something that returns files, and you're like 90% of the way there, and as
long as there's no money being ran through it, it's free as well! Granted,
some might need to run server side code, but, in most cases, I don't think an
average person does.</p></article><script src=/js/images.js></script></main><div class="bg-dark content-sizing footer" style=margin-top:2cm><div class=footer-flex><button class=button id=latex-convert-btn>Copy content as LaTeX</button>
