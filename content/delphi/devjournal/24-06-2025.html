<p>
  Oh my god, it's been awhile since I even touched this project. And here I am,
  I'm back to work on it... for another 2 or 3 days until I other things take 
  my attention away from it.
</p>

<h2>JS Support</h2>
<p>
  I've added JS support, although currently it's very basic and <i>very</i> 
  unsecure.
</p>
<p>
  In keeping with my love of ancient greek stuff, the JS integration module has
  been named <i>"Hephaestus"</i>, as the smith that's going to make these menus 
  actually functional. I'll show off a small bit of it functioning later, but 
  first, I'll talk about how I got it to start working.
</p>
<p>
  I knew that I wanted to use either Lua or JS for the scripting language, but, 
  after looking for Lua interpreters in Java I realized they're all either 
  abandoned or... very close the original C implementation (low level and 
  difficult to work with), I gave that up.
</p>
<p>
  For JavaScript, I basically only had 1 option: GraalVM's Polyglot engine. As 
  far as I'm aware, all of GraalVM is currently on an open source license so 
  its use is allowed. (Which was not the case some years ago).
</p>
<p>
  There was also Mozilla's Rhino engine which I used when writing a scripting 
  engine for a server me and my friends were making (ArcadiusMC), so I had 
  expirience with it, but I also knew its limits. The most major limit, or flaw,
  rather, is that it's stuck on ECMAScript version 5, which was released 10 
  years ago now. Graal's is upto date, as far as I'm aware and supports a 
  majority of the JS standard library (console.log lol)
</p>
<p>
  Working with Graal's polyglot, I do miss the layered scopes that Rhino had, 
  which broke down the data script's had access to into stacks, like, you know,
  how every language does. Graal doesn't have that, Graal has one (kinda 2) 
  scopes: the global scope. Not too big of an issue and it does make sense for
  the projet I'm working on, where all scripts loaded by a page should run in 
  the same scope and context anyway.
</p>
<p>
  Implementing GraalVM wasn't that time consuming, just add the depedencies, 
  and write another DomSystem... and then change about 50 other things to add 
  script support, make the loading of JS files easier and actually add the 
  system to the document instances. It works though, and here it is, in action:
</p>

<video controls>
  <source src="/delphi/js-1.mp4">
</video>

<p>
  As the video shows, you can use JS in both the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> 
  element's content, or link to a <code>.js</code> file with the 
  <code>src</code> attribute.
</p>
<p>
  And it works!! It runs! It actually does its job and you're able to use 
  Java objects, like the DOM and <code>DocumentView</code> with it.
</p>
<p>
  Granted, it's a very basic setup, and I want to curtail the access JS has to 
  the host VM, or maybe I don't?? I don't know yet. I want it to be powerful, 
  but I'm also worried it will be abused.
</p>
<p>
  For now, the only stdlib (yes, I'm calling it that) function available is
  <code>command(args...)</code> that lets you execute a console command, 
  example:
</p>
{{<highlight js>}}
// Simple command example
command(`tellraw @a "Hello, world"`)

// You can also use multiple arguments, they will be concatened
const player = server.getPlayer("JulieWoolie");
const amount = parseInt(view.getPath().getQuery("amount")) ?? 1
command("give", player.getName(), "minecraft_stick", amount)
{{</highlight>}}

<h2>Devtools Development</h2>
<p>
  I worked on the Devtools a bit, not a lot, but a bit. I'll be adding in 
  another tab: <i>"Actions"</i>, which will allow you to perform some actions 
  on the menu, such as:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Moving the menu</li>
  <li>Forcing it to re-render</li>
  <li>Closing the menu</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Ontop of that, I also fixed some bugs that were ocurring as a result of the 
  devtools and changed a few small things around. Namely:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The child node removal event is now fired <i>after</i> a node has been 
    removed from it's parents, not before.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed a concurrent modification exception when removing attributes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed another exception that ocurred when closing menus with a devtool 
    instance attached to them.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Minor changes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Added support for the new <code>TranslationStore</code> which allows me to 
    load components straight from the translation files
  </li>
  <li>
    Expanded the locale loader to also load any custom translations one might 
    want from the <code>plugins/Delphi/data/lang</code> directory.
  </li>
  <li>
    I'm now finally running off an M.2 SSD so I have an all new windows 
    installation, anyway, I installed Java 24, so the build process stopped 
    working <code>;-;</code>... jk fixed that.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed an error being thrown when removing the <code>style</code> attribute,
    caused by me forgetting to add a <code>return;</code> months and months ago.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Future plans</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Wrapping the DOM and Delphi APIs in <code>Proxy</code>s to make them 
    easier to use in JavaScript.
  </li>
  <li>
    Making the Renderer exclude the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> element from 
    being rendered.
  </li>
</ul>
