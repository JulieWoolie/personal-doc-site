<p>
  The Day started with me testing the measurement system only to find out it 
  worked... like as far as I could see, it worked. This was unexpected.
</p>
<p>
  There were some visual bugs I found, that I fixed after adjusting the 
  <code>BLOCK_OFFSET_X</code> from yesterday to <code>0.0717</code> which was 
  more accurate. And by making regular text render objects also apply the 
  offset. (Before, only the empty text displays used the offset) The results 
  produced by this were actually really good and fixed a visual error I 
  encountered this morning:
</p>

<figure>
  <img src="/delphi/before-blockoffset-adjust.png">
  <figcaption>Before adjusting the constant.</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure>
  <img src="/delphi/after-blockoffset-adjust.png">
  <figcaption>After adjusting the constant.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  After that, I worked in some support for the <code>box-sizing</code> 
  property.
</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/delphi/box-sizing-test.png">
  <figcaption>
    <code>box-sizing</code> test. The above is set to the default, 
    <code>content-box</code> value, while the lower container is set to 
    <code>border-box</code>.
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  As you can see, the below one fits perfectly inside the the content area of
  the upper box. A quick render tree dump confirms it, the element size of the 
  lower box is the exact same as the content area of the upper one! Yipeee!
</p>

<p>
  After that was fixed, I added some miscellaneous features to the XML parser:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    You can now write CSS styles inside the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> element 
    like so:
    {{< highlight html >}}
    <style>
      .btn {
        background-color: red;
      }
      .btn:hover {
        background-color: blue;
      }
    </style>
    {{< /highlight >}}
  </li>  
  <li>
    You can now write JSON inside <code>&lt;item&gt;</code> elements, 
    like so: 
    {{< highlight xml >}}
    <item>
      {
        "id": "minecraft:golden_pickaxe",
        "count": 1,
        "components": {
          "max_stack_size": 75,
          "enchantments": {
            "show_in_tooltip": true,
            "levels": {
              "minecraft:efficiency": 5,
              "minecraft:silk_touch": 1,
              "minecraft:mending": 1,
              "minecraft:unbreaking": 3
            }
          }
        }
      }
    </item>
    {{< /highlight >}}
  </li>
  <li>
    Added a new element: <code>&lt;chat-component&gt;</code>. You can write 
    JSON inside it like so:
    {{< highlight xml >}}
    <chat-component>
      {
        "text": "Hello, world!",
        "color":"red"
      }
    </chat-component>
    {{< /highlight >}}

  </li>
</ul>
