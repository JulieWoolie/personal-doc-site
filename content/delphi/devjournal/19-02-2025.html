  - "'Content source' means the source of the element's data. This is a value that can be in one of 3 states: `none`, `src_attribute` or `text_content`"
  - The `delphidom` module is the DOM API implementation and parser. It can only access the DOM API and Chimera's SCSS
  - "Contains Delphi's plugin code: commands, event listeners, DocumentView implementation and module system implementation. Notably, it is also the only module with access to the backend code of Bukkit. That access is required to load item stacks."

<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>
  Yeah, I kinda forgot about this project after I got a bit burned out. But I'm
  back and with some major changes to the structure of the API and the DOM tree.
</p>
<p>
  But before all that, little sneak peek at the dev tools I started working on:
</p>

</video>
<p>
  I'm just proud of how all of highlighting stuff and CSS style changing on the 
  fly works.
</p>

<h2>DOM Restructuring</h2>
<p>
  For context, before this, the actual part of the document represented by 
  Delphi's API was the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element. No other parts like 
  the head, or the root <code>&lt;page&gt;</code> element were not accessible.
  Those elements were parsed specially by the SAX parser and then disregarded.
</p>
<p>
  That has changed, now the entire document's XML is represented inside the 
  API. Mostly, this meant a big boring challenge for me to change things around.
  Before I needed only to worry about the DOM head elements during parsing, and 
  that was it, now I needed DOM elements to represent them. Elements that could 
  change arbitrarily at any time.
</p>
<p>
  To make this task easier, I came up with a thing called 
  <code>ObjectModelSystem</code>s. Think of them like Systems, and think of 
  elements like Components inside an Entity Component Framework.
</p>
<p>
  And now, after 2 days of boring work I have created the following systems.
</p>

<h3><code>OptionElementSystem</code></h3>
<p>
  This keeps the <code>&lt;option&gt;</code> elements in the head synced up 
  to the actual options accessible through 
</p>
<code>Document.getOption(String name)</code>.
<p>
  The difficulty with this system was figuring out how to handle the 
  option element itself. Because it used 2 attributes <i>"name"</i> and 
  <i>"value"</i> to store the option's value, and tracking both confused me.
</p>
<p>
  I dropped support for the <code>&lt;options&gt;</code> element completely.
  It was too much to keep that synced up as well.
</p>

<h3><code>StyleElementSystem</code></h3>
<p>
  This isn't the CSSOM system itself, just the system that keeps the 
  stylesheets linked to and parsed from style elements synced.
</p>
<p>
  When making this, I made a decision that set the precedent for the next 3
  systems as well. This being that a style element can link a stylesheet 
  with the <i>"src"</i> attribute, or specify the stylesheet in the text 
  content of the element.
</p>
<p>
  I opted to lock the <i>"content source"</i><note idx="0"></note> to one type and only listen 
  to changes to that type. This means that if you set the style element to 
  use the <i>"src"</i> attribute, then it will not care about any changes 
  to the element's content until the attribute is unset. This applies vice 
  versa as well to the text content.
</p>
<p>
  There was also a 2nd issue that would need solving. The systems that sync 
  and handle all of these things are located in the 
  <code>delphidom</code><note idx="1"></note> module, but methods that 
  access module files (<code>loadItemStack(uri)</code> and <code>loadStylesheet(uri)</code>)
  were implemented in the <code>delphiplugin</code><note idx="2"></note> 
  module. So these systems require that the document's view be initialized.
</p>
<p>
  This was solved by just storing all the style elements that exist and 
  iterating over them after the view had been initialized to check if they 
  needed to fetch a stylesheet through the loader.
</p>

<h3><code>ItemElementSystem</code> and <code>ComponentElementSystem</code></h3>
<p>
  These 2 function effectively identically but for different elements. The 
  first, <code>ItemElementSystem</code>, handles <code>&lt;item&gt;</code> 
  elements. The second, <code>ComponentElementSystem</code> handles 
  <code>&lt;chat-component&gt;</code> elements. The most major difference with 
  these from the previous style element system is that instead of requiring the
  document's view to be initialized for the <i>"src"</i> attribute to be loaded,
  they require it for both the attribute and for the text content.
</p>

<h2>Tag changes</h2>
<p>
  Some tag names were changed because I felt the tag names should either match 
  HTML names, or might be too broad to reserve them for system.
</p>
<dl>
  <dt><code>&lt;page&gt;</code> renamed to <code>&lt;delphi&gt;</code></dt>
  <dd>
    The <code>&lt;page&gt;</code> (Now <code>&lt;delphi&gt;</code>) is the 
    root element of any Delphi XML file. The <i>"page"</i> tag felt too broad
    to reserve as the root tag of a document.
  </dd>
  <dt><code>&lt;header&gt;</code> renamed to <code>&lt;head&gt;</code></dt>
  <dd>
    Consistency with HTML's <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tag. And there's also the 
    fact that <i>"header"</i> is an actual term for the top part of a document,
    so again, it felt wrong to reserve it as the keyword for a document's 
    metadata section.
  </dd>
  <dt>Dropping support for the <code>&lt;options&gt;</code> tag</dt>
  <dd>
    The options tag allowed you to specify multiple options inside one XML 
    element, like this:
    {{<highlight xml>}}
    <options screen-width="2" screen-height="3"/>
    {{</highlight>}}

    <p>
      This was too much to manage with the aforementioned dom refactoring. So I
      dropped support for it.
    </p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2>Miscellaneous Stuff</h2>
<p>
  I dropped a literally useless <code>root</code> function argument from all 
  selectors (Test function signature used to be: <code>boolean test(Element 
  root, Element element)</code>). That argument does not mean the root of the 
  DOM tree, but rather the root element at which the query was started. I added 
  that, because of a misunderstanding with how CSS selectors function.
</p>

<h2>Worries</h2>
<p>
  This is a section that will just describe some of my issues or bugs that will 
  probably pop up.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    There is no listener or update callback for if a document's body element 
    is removed or changed, neither the CSS or render system is updated when 
    that happens. In fact I think it may start producing errors as it expects 
    the body to always be there, instead of being null.
  </li>
  <li>
    Similar worry, except for the head element. There's no callback or listener 
    for if the head element is just removed. It can happen, idk why, but it can 
    happen. So I should probably listen for it and handle things accordingly.
  </li>
</ul>
