<p>
  This, unlike the previous entries is being written retrospectively, so there 
  will be missing screenshots and things.
</p>
<p>
  I added support for inline margins, this means implementing the 
  <code>margin-inline</code>, <code>margin-inline-start</code> and 
  <code>margin-inline-end</code> Properties. Normal margins won't be used on 
  non-block render objects anymore, but inline margins will.
</p>
<p>
  After that, I mostly finished implementing the Flow layout algorithm, with the
  caveat that I don't know how to handle max sizes on elements without them 
  being too large or small. So I just gave up and used the screen's size as the 
  maximum size.
</p>

<h2>Ditching the <code>scale</code> property and <code>GLOBAL_SCALAR</code></h2>
<p>
  Then came the big thing. Up until this point I was using a scalar for 
  basically every element in the form of both a <code>GLOBAL_SCALAR</code> 
  (<code>0.5</code>) and a <code>scale</code> CSS property. This was bad code 
  and a mess to reason through. So I have removed it and in its place are some 
  alternatives: <code>&lt;item&gt;</code> elements can be scaled by just setting
  the <code>with</code> and <code>height</code> properties directly. While text
  can be scaled with a <code>font-size</code> property.
</p>
<p>
  I wasn't sure how to properly implement the <code>font-size</code> property, 
  so, at the moment it accepts either a base numerical value, or a percent 
  value. In the case of percent values, the number is divided by 100 and then 
  used as the text's scalar. If no percent is used, the number itself is used 
  as the text scalar.
</p>
<p>
  Text by itself is way too big on screens, so there's a 
  <code>GLOBAL_FONT_SCALAR</code> which is set to the previous 
  <code>GLOBAL_SCALAR</code> value of <code>0.5</code>.
</p>

<h2>Chimera: get and set property functions</h2>
<p>
  I added 2 functions to the Chimera SCSS engine:
</p>
<dl>
  <dt><code>get-property(propertyName)</code></dt>
  <dd>
    Returns the value of a property in the current scope, for example:
    {{< highlight scss >}}
    .rule {
      margin-left: 1px;
      @debug get-property("margin-left"); // 1.0px
    }
    {{< /highlight >}}
  </dd>
  <dt><code>set-property(propertyName, value, important?)</code></dt>
  <dd>
    Set the value of a property in the current scope, for example:

    {{< highlight scss >}}
    .rule {
      set-property("margin-left", 2px);
      @debug get-property("margin-left"); // 2.0px
    }
    {{< /highlight >}}

    <p>
      The third parameter, <code>important</code>, is an optional one and allows
      you to mark the property as important, like with <code>!important</code> 
      in regular CSS.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did have to majorly break SCSS rules to allow you to just call functions
      without assigning their return value to a property or variable.
    </p>
  </dd>
</dl>
These functions should make it easier to do stuff similar to this in 
regular SCSS.
<br>
Normal SCSS:
{{< highlight scss >}}
.rule {
  $colors: ("background": red, "outline": green);
  @each($prop, $color in $colors) {
    #{$prop}-color: $color;
  }
}
{{< /highlight >}}

Chimera SCSS:
{{< highlight scss >}}
.rule {
  $colors: ("background": red, "outline": green);
  @each($prop, $color in $colors) {
    set-property($prop + "-color", $color);
  }
}
{{< /highlight >}}
The most ironic part about these examples is that <code>@each</code> and maps 
aren't supported in Chimera at time of writing.

<h2>Chimera: Mixins</h2>
<p>
  I added very basic support for mixins to Chimera's SCSS. Currently, this is 
  the most you can do with them:
</p>
{{< highlight scss >}}
@mixin mixin-name {
  background-color: red;
}
.rule {
  @include mixin-name;
}
{{< /highlight >}}

<h2>Misc. stuff</h2>
<p>
  And now for the rest of the miscellaneous stuff I added:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Improved the testing system Chimera has</li>
  <li>Added the <code>if($condition, $if-true, $if-false)</code> function to Chimera</li>
  <li>Some internal changes to Chimera's lists</li>
  <li>Implement the <code>visibility</code> CSS property.</li>
  <li>
    Add support for hiding elements from NLayout and rendering 
    (<code>display: none;</code> and <code>visibility: hidden;</code>).
  </li>
</ul>
