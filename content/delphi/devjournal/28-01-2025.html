<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>
  It's been weeks, maybe even months since I've touched this project... oh god.
</p>
<p>
  I started finally implementing the renderer I created in the 
  <code>delphirender</code> module. Starting with a very simple Flow layout 
  that just places elements after each other. I'll implement the rest of the 
  layout once I know the configuration and projection of entities is correct.
</p>

<h2>Afterword</h2>
<p>
  It's 7 hours later. I hate this project...
</p>
<p>
  I spent almost all of today thinking about and fixing issues related to the 
  most simple parts of rendering and layout possible. And now, 7 hours later, 
  this still doesn't work fully. There's still many issues to fix.
</p>
<p>
  For some reason all elements are offset slightly to the left, and maybe down 
  a bit? This probably has something to do with the code expecting 
  <code>content-start</code><note idx="0"></note> position to be relative to 
  something it isn't anymore.
</p>
<p>
  Other than the bugs that didn't exist before, all is well. I'll need to remind
  myself to take screenshots and maybe even videos so I can show stuff off here.
</p>

<h3>A little rant</h3>
<p>
  Mojang, I know they didn't do this to screw me over, but it just feels like 
  they did. They changed the way Text Display entities are rendered in 
  <a href="https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-263858" target="_blank">MC-263858</a>.
  Just a minor change right? Wrong! The method all of Delphi's menus were 
  rendered with was by using that 1 pixel of invisible background on empty text
  displays. And they fixed it!
</p>
<p>
  So, I had to take an hour to fix that. Delphi now uses a '0' character set to
  opacity 24, which, according to the wiki, is invisible because any opacity 
  under 25 is not rendered.
</p>

<h2>Tomorrow's goals</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Eliminate the new bugs</li>
  <li>Work on layout (Flow layout)</li>
  <li>Get auto margins working.</li>
  <li>
    Fix chunk loading/unloading errors.

    <p>
      When a chunk with a Delphi menu in it is unloaded and then loaded again,
      the menu will be gone because the entities are not persistend (this is 
      intentional), so they will need to be manually respawned when the chunk 
      is loaded again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Entities should also be marked as invalid and killed when the chunk is 
      unloaded.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Thinking of the future: Translations</h2>
<p>
  Delphi will need to support translations to other languages and as such will
  need to support languages and text in other languages.
</p>
<p>
  The first issue to solve is related to translated messages, although these
  may rarely appear, it may be important to provide support for them. Currently,
  the server software the plugin is written for, Paper, only has English 
  translations stored server side. As such, we'll most likely need to download
  the current version's client jar and extract the translation files for other
  languages from there. This should go further, to cover all possible bases, it
  should also download the Server Resource Pack, specified by 
  <code>server-resource-pack</code> in <code>server.properties</code>.
