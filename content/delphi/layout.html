<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  This document describes the process of writing the <i>NLayout</i> engine that
  executes layout for Delphi and how it works.
</p>
<p>
  This part, the layout engine, has been the most difficult part of the Delphi 
  project to date, executing layout with so many variables that interact in so 
  many different ways depending on layout context and such.
</p>
<p>
  The layout engine is part of the <code>delphirender</code> module which
  handles DOM rendering and Minecraft entity management.
</p>

<h3>The Name</h3>
<p>
  <i>NLayout</i> just means <i>"New Layout"</i>, after the Java class I started
  writing it in, which was the 2nd version of the layout engine. The first being
  very primitive, just taking in a <code>layout-direction</code> (Either X or Y)
  and tiling elements in that direction.
</p>

<h2>Layout passes</h2>
<p>
  Layout is divided into passes, and this section describes the initial concept
  for the engine and the passes it executed.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Note: </b> Passes are executed either bottom-to-up (Starting at the 
  deepest elements and iterating up through the tree), or top-to-bottom 
  (Starting at the root element and iterating through its children)
</p>

<h3>Intrinsic Measurement</h3>
<p>
  Measure every style property that can be measured (everything that isn't 
  'auto' or a percent value.), this also includes node content, if present.
</p>
<p>
  This pass is done bottom to top
</p>

<h3>Resolve parent based sizes, if possible</h3>
<p>
  Iterate from root downwards, attempt to resolve all possible relative sizes 
  (% unit values)
</p>

<h3>Layout</h3>
<p>
  Iterate from the bottom up and apply the appropriate layout algorithms for 
  each element. Skip content nodes, and nodes without child objects.
</p>
<p>
  As this step is being executed, the sizes of each element will be set as well.
  This means, this will require an additional step after to finally resolve all
  %-based values. (I think)
</p>
<p>
  Use the appropriate algorithm for each layout mode:
</p>
<dl>
  <dt><code>display: flex</code></dt>
  <dd>Flex layout</dd>
  <dt><code>position: absolute</code></dt>
  <dd>Position Layout</dd>
  <dt>Otherwise</dt>
  <dd>Flow layout</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Flow</h4>
<p>
Split elements into 'lines' of elements. Iterate over child elements.
<br>
If element is 'display: inline' it is part of the current line.
<br>
If the <code>currentLineWidth + element.size.x + element.margin.x()</code> is
greater than <code>maxWidth</code> => line break.
<br>
If <code>display: inline-block</code> => line break after element.
<br>
If <code>position: absolute</code> => skip, do not include in line.
</p>
<p>
  When iterating over elements, keep track of the largest margin separately. 
  This is because all elements will sit on the same baseline, but the margin of
  each on the bottom can vary, and the largest margin becomes the line's bottom
  margin.
</p>
<p>
  After all elements are split into lines, lay them out in the way specified by
  the lines. Include bottom margin when moving from 1 line to another.
</p>

<h4>Position</h4>
<p>
  Move current element to position specified by 'left', and 'top' properties, 
  ignore all existing elements and do not count element in parent element's 
  size measurement.
</p>

<h4>Flex</h4>
<p>
  Create a <code>mainDir: vec2</code>, and a <code>crossDir: vec2</code> with 
  values appropriate to the <code>flex-direction</code> property.
  <br>
  <code>flex-direction: row | row-reverse => mainDir = (1, 0), crossDir = (0, 1)</code>
  <br>
  <code>flex-direction: column | column-reverse => mainDir = (0, 1), crossDir = (1, 0)</code>
</p>

<h3>Post Processing</h3>
<p>
  This pass is performed in the same order as PASS 3: Layout. This step involves
  applying post layout operations like handling <code>margin: auto</code> 
  properties.
</p>

<h4>Flow</h4>
<p>
  After Flow layout is conducted, measure element size (if width was not 
  explicitly set) and re-iterate over <code>display: block</code> elements to 
  apply any <code>auto</code> margin values. 
</p>
<p>
  Left and right margins determine the x-axis layout of the element, if both 
  are <code>auto</code>, then the <code>x margins = (parentContentArea.x - elementSize.x) / 2</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Otherwise, the auto margin = <code>parentContentArea.x - elementSize.x - oppositeMargin</code>. 
</p>
<p>
  The other 2 margins determine the vertical layout of the element. For these 
  calculations, we'll need a variable, <code>N</code>, which is equal to 
  <code>parentContentArea.y - usedSpace.y + elementSize.y</code>.
</p>
<p>
  If both <code>top</code> and <code>bottom</code> are 'auto', then <code>y margin = (N - elementSize.y) / 2</code>
  Otherwise, the <code>auto margin = N - elementSize.y</code>.
</p>
