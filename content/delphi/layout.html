<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  This document describes the process of writing the <i>NLayout</i> engine that
  executes layout for Delphi and how it works.
</p>
<p>
  This part, the layout engine, has been the most difficult part of the Delphi 
  project to date, executing layout with so many variables that interact in so 
  many different ways depending on layout context and such.
</p>
<p>
  The layout engine is part of the <code>delphirender</code> module which
  handles DOM rendering and Minecraft entity management.
</p>

<h3>The Name</h3>
<p>
  <i>NLayout</i> just means <i>"New Layout"</i>, after the Java class I started
  writing it in, which was the 2nd version of the layout engine. The first being
  very primitive, just taking in a <code>layout-direction</code> (Either X or Y)
  and tiling elements in that direction.
</p>

<h2>Layout passes</h2>
<p>
  Layout is divided into passes, and this section describes the initial concept
  for the engine and the passes it executed.
</p>

<h3>Measurement</h3>
<p>
  Iterate over each element, and measure it, calculate style properties, 
  padding, margins, etc.
</p>
<p>
  This pass uses a stack of vector2s called <code>parentSizes</code>, as 
  elements are measured and we move onto their child elements, we push the 
  element's content size onto the stack. And pop after we finish
</p>
<p>
  If an element's size is set, then we use that as the element's size, 
  otherwise, we calculate the size based off of it's child elements and layout 
  algorithm.
</p>
<p>
  Firstly, if an element's size is based off of it's child elements, we assume
  the element's initial size to be the screen's size and then calculate its 
  child elements. We then adjust the element's size to be the measured result.
  Then, the whole process is executed over and over until the child elements 
  stop changing their size, aka, until the layout stabilizes.
</p>

<h3>Layout</h3>
<p>
  Layout is performed by Layout algorithms, each executing it differently. At 
  time of writing only Flow is supported.
</p>

<h4>Flow layout</h4>
<p>
  Take the child elements of the element we're laying out and break them into 
  lines. To do that, we iterate over each one, skipping ones with 
  <code>display: hide;</code>. If an element is not <code>display: inline</code> 
  or its too big for the current line, a line break is triggered. If the 
  element is <code>display: block</code> another line break is triggered after 
  the element.
</p>
<p>
  Then all the elements are laid out. Elements on the same line are stacked 
  horizontally, while lines are stacked vertically.
</p>
<p>
  After layout has finished, iterate over all child elements with 
  <code>display: block</code>. And check if they have any horizontal auto 
  margins. If they do, properly move the element according to those margins: Do
  nothing if only right margin is set to auto. Move element to the ride side of 
  the parent's content if only left margin is set, and center element if both 
  are set.
