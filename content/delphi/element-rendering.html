<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  This document describes the process of turning DOM elements into render 
  objects and how those objects are rendered into display entities.
</p>
<p>
  The rendering is part of the <code>delphirender</code> module.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Note:</b> The document uses a lot of pseudo code with syntax similar to 
  TypeScript, but breaks it occasionally for simplicity or brevity.
</p>

<h2>Data Structure</h2>
<p>
  At the heart of the renderer is the data structure which more or less maps 
  render objects to their DOM elements.
</p>
<p>
  This uses a generic base class called <code>RenderObject</code> which does 
  very little.
</p>
{{<highlight ts>}}
abstract class RenderObject {
  position: Vector2f
  size: Vector2f
  depth: float

  abstract spawn(): void
  abstract kill(): void
}
{{</highlight>}}
<p>
  Aside from some utility functions and methods, that is all the class declares.
  Almost all of the heavy lifting is up to its inheritors. This class is 
  extended by another render object class, whose purpose is to make handling 
  render objects that only use 1 display entity easier:
</p>
{{<highlight ts>}}
  abstract class SingleEntityRenderObject<T extends Display> : RenderObject {
    entity: T?

    abstract spawnEntity(w: World, l: Location): T

    protected configure(entity: T, trans: Transformation): void {
      // Left for child classes to override
    }

    spawn(): void {
      // Bunch of stuff covered later
    }

    kill(): void {
      // Bunch of stuff covered later
    }
  }
{{</highlight>}}
<p>
  The <code>SingleEntityRenderObject</code> is extended by several other classes:
</p>
<dl>
  <dt><code>BoxRenderObject</code></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      This is a simple render object that is used to render a single rectangle.
    </p>
    <p>
      When spawned, this render object sets the text display entity's content to
      be a single <code>0</code> character with text opacity <code>24</code>. 
      Because any text opacity under 26 stops the text from even being 
      rendered... for some reason.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt><code>TextRenderObject</code></dt>
  <dd>
    These are themselves actually an abstract class, divided into 
    <code>StringRenderObject</code> and <code>ComponentRenderObject</code>, but
    they behave almost identically.
  </dd>

  <dt><code>ItemRenderObject</code></dt>
  <dd>
    Responsible for rendering itemstacks.
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>
  And lastly, there is the <code>ElementRenderObject</code>:
</p>
{{<highlight ts>}}
class ElementRenderObject: RenderObject {
  boxes: BoxRenderObject[]
  children: List<RenderObject>

  style: FullStyle
  comp: ComputedStyleSet
}
{{</highlight>}}
<p>
  They store the background (padding), border and outline as 
  <code>BoxRenderObject</code>s in their boxes array, along with a list of 
  child elements. Element render objects also store a 
  <code>ComputedStyleSet</code> which is the exact same style set as stored in 
  the CSS object model. Meaning that any changes to the CSS object model are 
  easily accessible in the render object. And the <code>style: FullStyle</code> 
  contains the fully computed style values.
</p>
<p>
  The <code>boxes</code> array in element render objects is initialized to 
  always be length 3, with each box being set to particular a part of the 
  element:
</p>
<ol start="0">
  <li>Background (padding)</li>
  <li>Border</li>
  <li>Padding</li>
</ol>
<p>
  Each of these boxes also has their depth calculated by iterating over each 
  box and multiplying its index by <code>MICRO_LAYER_DEPTH</code> and adding 
  the element render object's <code>depth</code> to it.
</p>

<h3>DOM to Render Tree Mapping</h3>
<p>
  This section describes how the DOM is mapped to the render tree. Since this 
  mapping process is handled differently per DOM Element and Node, I'll describe
  the conversion cases.
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Text nodes</dt>
  <dd>
    Text nodes are easily mapped by simply creating a 
    <code>TextRenderObject</code> instance with the text node's content as the 
    render object's content.
  </dd>

  <dt><code>&lt;chat-component&gt;</code> elements</dt>
  <dd>
    An element render object is created, with it's <code>comp</code> field 
    linked to the DOM element's style set. Then a single text render object is 
    created (Same as in a text node's case) and set as the only child element 
    of the element render object.
  </dd>

  <dt><code>&lt;item&gt;</code> elements</dt>
  <dd>
    A <code>ItemRenderObject</code> is created with the item element's item 
    stack as its content. Then we create an element render object, and set the 
    item render object as its only child.
  </dd>

  <dt>Elements</dt>
  <dd>
    An element render object is created. Then we iterate over all children of 
    the DOM element and perform this same mapping on them, with the resulting 
    render objects being added as children to the first element render object.
  </dd>
</dl>
<p>
  All render objects have their <code>depth</code> field calculated by taking 
  DOM node's depth (Which is a flat integer) and multiplying it with 
  <code>MACRO_LAYER_DEPTH</code>.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Note:</b> For <code>&lt;item&gt;</code> and 
  <code>&lt;chat-component&gt;</code> render objects, the depths of the item 
  render object and text render object inside the resulting element render 
  object have to be manually set when mapping from the DOM.
</p>

<h2>Constants</h2>
<p>
  This section will define some constants and try to quickly describe them.
</p>
<dl>
  <dt><code>CHAR_PX_SIZE_X</code> and <code>CHAR_PX_SIZE_Y</code></dt>
  <dd>
    The size of a single pixel on an unscaled text display. Both constants
    are equal to <code>0.025</code>
  </dd>

  <dt><code>CH_0_SIZE_X</code></dt>
  <dd>
    The width (in pixels) of a text display with the content <code>"0"</code>. 
    This constant includes both the character pixels and the 1 pixel of padding
    the display entity has on both the left and right sides.

    <p>The value of this constant is <code>7.0</code></p>
  </dd>

  <dt><code>CH_0_SIZE_Y</code></dt>
  <dd>
    The height (in pixels) of a text display with the content <code>"0"</code>. 
    This constant includes both the character pixels and the 1 pixel of padding
    the display entity has on both the top and bottom.

    <p>The value of this constant is <code>10.0</code></p>
  </dd>

  <dt><code>EMPTY_TD_BLOCK_SIZE_X</code></dt>
  <dd>
    The X scale of a text display with the content <code>"0"</code> stretched to
    fill a whole block.

    <p>
      The value of this constant is 
      <code>1.0f / (CHAR_PX_SIZE_X * CH_0_SIZE_X)</code> or around 
      <code>5.714286</code>
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt><code>EMPTY_TD_BLOCK_SIZE_Y</code></dt>
  <dd>
    The Y scale of a text display with the content <code>"0"</code> stretched to
    fill a whole block.

    <p>
      The value of this constant is 
      <code>1.0f / (CHAR_PX_SIZE_Y * CH_0_SIZE_Y)</code> or <code>4.0</code>
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt><code>BLOCK_OFFSET_X</code></dt>
  <dd>
    The distance between a text display entity's visual center and its entity 
    origin point when it's been scaled to <code>EMPTY_TD_BLOCK_SIZE_X</code> 
    and <code>EMPTY_TD_BLOCK_SIZE_Y</code>.

    <p>
      The value of this constant is <code>0.0717</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      I won't lie, this is a bad name for this constant.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt><code>MICRO_LAYER_DEPTH</code></dt>
  <dd>
    The distance between each box inside an element render object on the Z axis.
    <p>
      The value of this constant is <code>0.0001</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Note:</b> This is the smallest I could make this value before Z 
      fighting became a major issue. Luckily, this value is also small enough so
      it doesn't look like elements are floating above other elements too 
      obviously.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt><code>MACRO_LAYER_DEPTH</code></dt>
  <dd>
    The distance between each render object on the Z axis.
    <p>
      The value of this constant is <code>MICRO_LAYER_DEPTH * 3</code>, or 
      <code> 0.0003</code>.
    </p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2>Render Screen</h2>
<p>
  The render screen is a plane defined by a position, normal and 4 corners. It 
  is the plane onto which render objects are drawn.
</p>
<p>
  Render screens, although defined by the aforementioned properties, also 
  contain more information. For one, render screens can be rotated to face any 
  direction and be in any orientation possible. Screens can also be scaled.
</p>
<p>
  To accomplish this, they also maintain a left rotation, scale and right 
  rotation values.
</p>
<p>
  It's required to note that the initial size of the screen is not changed when
  the screen is transformed, rather a scalar is applied to it. This gives us 
  another property that is needed for projection later: 
  <code>screenDimensionScale</code>. This property is the difference between the
  set screen size and the actual size of the screen in the world.
</p>

<h2>Rendering Transformations</h2>
<p>
  To render an element, the resulting display entity needs to be transformed in 
  a variety of ways to align it correctly to where it is intended to be, and to 
  ensure is aligned to the screen.
</p>
<p>
  Firstly, I'm going to clarify for anyone that isn't aware, Minecraft provides 
  us with 4 transformations that are stored in a 
  <code>Transformation</code> object. These 4 transformations are, in order:
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Translation</dt>
  <dd>This moves, offsets, the entity by a specified amount</dd>

  <dt>Left Rotation</dt>
  <dd>
    Rotates the entity. Called left rotation because it is applied before 
    scaling, the next step
  </dd>

  <dt>Scaling</dt>
  <dd>
    Multiplies the entity's size.
  </dd>

  <dt>Right Rotation</dt>
  <dd>
    Rotates the entity. Called right rotation because it is applied after 
    scaling.
  </dd>
</dl>


<h3>Translation</h3>
<p>
  Render objects consider their origin point to be the top left corner of the 
  object's bounding box, display entities, however, are aligned differently.
  Text Displays are aligned to the bottom middle <note idx="0"></note>, while 
  Item displays are aligned to the center middle of the entity.
</p>
<p>
  As such, to align the entity correctly, we first offset the entity along the 
  X axis by half the render object's size. Then, depending on if the entity is 
  an item display or text display, we offset by either half its height, or by 
  its full height, respectively on the Y axis.
</p>
<p>
  And the Z component of the translation becomes equal to the render object's 
  depth value, plus the <code>z-index</code> value, multiplied by 
  <code> 2.9999999e-4</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Text and Box render objects also have to compensate for the visual alignment 
  offset bug display entities have. <note idx="0"></note>. To get the 
  compensation value, the scaling step has to be performed first (See next 
  section). After that we use the following function:
</p>
{{<highlight java>}}
  public static float visualCenterOffset(float scaleX) {
    return BLOCK_OFFSET_X * (scaleX / EMPTY_TD_BLOCK_SIZE_X);
  }
{{</highlight>}}
<p>
  The value returned from this function is then subtracted from X translation 
  of the text display.
</p>

<h3>Scaling</h3>
<p>
  Scaling is handled in a complicated to describe way. As such, I'll describe 
  how its performed per each object type:
</p>
<dl>
  <dt><code>ItemRenderObject</code></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Since we know that an item's sprite is, by default, the size of a block in 
      GUI render mode, we can easily figure out the transformation scale by just 
      dividing the intended size by that constant size.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a side note, item displays are scaled down on the Z axis to prevent 
      them from popping out of the page or from clipping into it. The Z scale is
      a constant of <code>0.075</code>. Values less than this tend to mess with
      the entity's brightness in unexpected ways.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt><code>TextRenderObject</code></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      First, the object's base text size is measured. Then the intended size of 
      the element is divided by the measured text's size to get the X and Y 
      scale. Z scale remains unchanged.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt><code>BoxRenderObject</code></dt>
  <dd>
    The scale is gotten by multiplying the object's size x and y sizes with the 
    <code>EMPTY_TD_BLOCK_SIZE_X</code> and <code>EMPTY_TD_BLOCK_SIZE_Y</code> 
    constants respectively.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h3>Projection</h3>
<p>
  Projection is what I choose to call the part of transformation where the 
  display entity is rotated and scaled to be aligned to the screen.
</p>
<p>
  First the X and Y components of the display translation are multiplied by the 
  <code>screenDimensionScale</code>. Then the display scale is multiplied by 
  screen's scale. Then the screen's left and right rotations are applied onto 
  the display translation. And finally, the display's left and right rotations 
  are multiplied by the screen's left and right rotations respectively.
</p>

<h3>Notes on Transformations</h3>
<p>
  <code>ItemRenderObject</code>s perform the translation and scaling step 
  differently. They execute the same operations, however, they do not use their 
  own render object's size to perform these calculations, they use the parent 
  size.
</p>
<p>
  This is because otherwise, the item display wouldn't scale as intended with 
  CSS changes to the parent <code>ElementRenderObject</code>.
</p>
