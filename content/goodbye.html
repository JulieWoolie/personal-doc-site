<h2>For they who doth care,</h2>
<section>
  <p>
    I write this letter in the same manner which I lived: Mediocre and behind the
    times. In a world in which I had not failed miserably to apply myself, to
    become who I dreamed of being, this letter would not have been written.
    Instead, I would have been with friends, or a partner, or partners. Who
    knows what an iteration of me who is not burdened with despair would look
    like.
  </p>
  <p>
    I dreamed of writing epics, of creating art or programs, of speaking a
    dozen languages, or being at the head of some metaphorical or literal ship.
    However, that is all I appear to be: A  dreamer. I dreamed of marble halls
    and golden chairs, clothes of exquisite weave and make. Yet I lack the will,
    or the strength or the drive to see that my life be one of the grandeur I
    dream of.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the top of it all my failures, many of which I can only blame myself for,
    there lays my inability to connect, or to trust another human. I witnessed
    all those I called friends grow up. I saw them make friends, find partners
    in a manner I could not dream of, at a speed with which I could not match. I
    can pound the wall with my fist and scream at all the causes I perceive to
    have removed my ability to connect, but it matters not. I've delayed enough,
    and I've lost too much time. All I see myself able to do, is mourn, before
    it all ends.
  </p>
  <p>
    Make no mistake, I enjoyed moments, moments when I was able to be happy
    around others, able to share in banter, although that was rare. But
    enjoyment of rare moments does not offset the failures of the majority of
    my time.
  </p>
  <p>
    The last comfort I shall have, is that I will be forgotten. If I may be
    granted one thing, it's that I be forgotten, my name be erased and a void
    left where I was. That hope of being erased, gives me great comfort. It's
    shame, I think. I failed and for that I feel such great shame that it gives
    me comfort to know my failure might be forgotten. My sins burned away.
  </p>
  <p>
    To those that knew me closely, forgive me. I know this action to be one of
    the most selfish I could perform, but, when, in reality, have I ever been
    anything but? Thank you for providing me comfort, joy, and some faint sense
    of connection and belonging before the end. Were it not for you, I may have
    departed far sooner.
  </p>
  <p>
    The forest, the winter air and all the blasted snow will be cold and it'll
    bite at me. But at least, I will have fucking died somewhere other than
    the bedroom I rotted away in, the bedroom I wasted so much of my time in.
  </p>
  <p>
    <br>Best regards,<br>Julie

<h2><i>"No."</i> She answered</h2>

<section class="poem">
  <p>
    I once begged:<br>
    <i>"Grant me fortune, o lord Apollo<br>
    Grant me peace, lord Hades<br>
    Grant me knowledge, great lady Athena"</i><br>
    But did I pray or sacrifice for my pleas?<br>
    No.
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>"Was my dance elegant?"</i> I ask<br>
    <i>"Was my singing pleasant?<br>
      Was my performance magnificent?<br>
      Was I good at existing?"</i><br>
    No.
  </p>
  <p>
    Alone I shall leave.<br>
    The cold biting at my skin.<br>
    <i>"Did I accomplish anything?<br>
      Will I be remembered?"</i><br>
    No.
  </p>
  <p>
    That shall comfort me in my last hour.<br>
    I'll be forgotten<br>
    Good.
