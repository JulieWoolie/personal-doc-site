<p>
  Hi, I'm Julie, a trans girl :3
</p>
<p>
  I mostly make Java plugins for PaperMC for fun. I like programming, fantasy 
  worlds, cartography (maps), flags and coats of arms and other nerdy stuff.
</p>
<p>
  I mainly like programming tools and libraries and I'm interested in how the 
  things we use are written (browsers, game engines, compilers, IDEs, tool 
  related stuff like that) The actual things you make with those tools don't 
  capture me as much, sadly :(

<h4>What's with this website design?</h4>
<p>
  I just wanted a website where I could write stuff in HTML and have it show up 
  looking like an official A4 document. So I made this website, with simple, 
  kinda ugly styling because I like it.
</p>
<h4>Copy content as LaTeX?</h4>
<p>
  Yeah, when I first made this website, I hosted it on my PC for just me, so I 
  needed to turn the stuff I wrote into PDFs in order to send them to others, 
  so I wrote a HTML to LaTeX converter
</p>
<h4>What's with the background?</h4>
<p>
  By default, it's just gray because I like dark themes, light themes hurt my 
  eyes. If you click toggle background at the bottom though (not visible on 
  mobile), you get hell ðŸ¥°
