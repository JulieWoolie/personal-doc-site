<h2>Info</h2>
<p>
  The Gods live atop the Holy Mountain of Hadria (Afin Region) in an expansive 
  palace. The mountain is so inhospitable that any mortal who encroaches upon 
  the gods will die. No amount of clothes or magic will keep anyone safe. 
  However there have been a select few that have visited the Gods. One notable 
  person to be allowed to visit the gods was the First Emperor Adis, who after
  death became king of the gods and his body was taken by the gods to Hadria 
  and resurrected.
</p>

<p>
  The gods were the first humans to exist and founded the world. Not wanting to
  be disturbed they created the Hadria mountain range. The gods made a promise
  to create humanity and not disturb it for 2000 years. For those 2000 years
  they looked on in horror, but also they accepted what humans had become. Even
  after the 2000 years had ended, the gods did not interfear.

<p>
  In the first temple ever built, The Temple of the six there is an orb made of
  magic, if this were to go out the Seal between Horandia and the Human plane
  would be destroyed. The fire can be kept by either 6 Priests who have devoted
  their entire life and have had their chasitidy Secured by the removel of their
  genitals. Or it can be kept by Emperors of Divine Blood (Sucsessors of Adis)
</p>

<p>
  The First Gods lived with the Evil Gods. But when the Gods created humans, the
  Evil gods started stealing from and killing the humans. What finally made the 
  Good Gods snap was the Murder of 12,560 citizens in the Bian Region. The gods 
  intervened and tried to banish them to Horandia.The Evil gods Resisted and 
  fought with the Gods. Their battle resulted in the total destuction of 
  South-East Bian Region, creating theBian Plains. The Gods were victorious and
  the Evil Gods Were banished to Horandia.

<p>
  The only person to ever make it to the gods without their summon was Alexius 
  Karlius Vexium the worlds best gladiator. He fought for 23 years and as a gift
  the emperor allowed him to go free. After his visit of the Gods he is belived
  to have been made Protector of the Gods. an immortal being to Protect the 
  Gods, forever standing guard at the Gate.
</p>

<p>
  The Gods have also imposed limitations upon themselves, on of these is that 
  they can be killed. For the gods belive that if anyone makes it to them with 
  hostile intention, they should be allowed to excecute their wish.
</p>

<p>The Gods do not need to eat. Sometimes they eat for the taste.</p>

<p>Natural Children of the gods do exist, but there are only 3 left alive.</p>

<p>At this current time the gods have taken a wow of non interfearance.</p>
