## Intro

The following text is from the book “Fabulam Adis “or “The Story of Adis “it is also known by its longer title “the Story of Adis, the conqueror, emperor and the man who became a god “It was written by Uliksos, an Afinian scholar who sold himself into slavery, he advised Adis and later tutored his son Tulone.
  
I tell the story of a man named Adis Econius Livius, who later was named Adis Econius Victormagnus Imperator. Now this man lives in Hadrid with the gods as a god. The scope of this man’s life was vast, I dare say that this text will be the prime source of history regarding the great man.
I shall start the text at my first contact with Adis and end at my last conversation with the man.
  
## Chapter 1: Slave Auction

To add personal context to the beginning. I was born in Axiussius; a village close to Afiniopolis. I had become a scholar however had no source of income as no none wanted me as a tutor. This fact forced me to put my life into the hands of the gods and sell my body into slavery, to pay off debts. I was taken to Eretene and given to a noble named Farsos to be sold to another noble.
  
This is where my first meeting with Adis Econius Livius occurred. I was pulled by my shackles to the wooden stage alongside other slaves. The auction master went through the slaves, yelling to the slave owners the qualities of each person before auctioning them off. As the 4th man from me was being auctioned I saw a tall man with blonde hair and blue eyes push to the front and then analyze the slaves. I noticed this man not make a bet on any of the slaves.
  
The auction master approached me and informed the crowd “This slave is not a simple slave, he cannot even lift a bucket of wine, but this slave is a learned Afinian scholar, quite knowledgeable in the arts of the tongue, politics and sciences! This smart slave will cost double the others!” The auction master then stated my price “Price starts at 6300 Lugns” The tall blonde man in the front raised his arm and shouted” I am in need of a learned slave; I shall grant you 12600 Lugns for him” Not another auctioneer raised his hand. “Sold to the blonde man” yelled the Auction master.
Quickly was I then pulled away from the crowd and painfully marked with an Iron and the initials “A.E.L” and handed to the man.
  
“Follow me” He instructed before moving towards an alleyway. I quickly followed. “My name’s Adis Econius Livius, I am a general in the king’s army” “Yes dominus” I replied. We headed through the streets to this man’s Villa.
  
Upon my entry to this man’s villa my eyes were greeted by a sight most beautiful. I saw a beautiful house, which was decorated from head to toe in patterns and mosaics visualizing historical and religious scenes.
  
The man was approached by an upset woman, who was not happy to see the man. “Proclus take this slave to the new room” Adis instructed another slave. “With me, please” Proclus said. I was lead to where I would be living.
  
I spent the month advising and assisting Adis.

## Chapter 2: the first war
On the morning I was writing a letter which Adis was dictating to me, when we were disrupted by a clearly exhausted man, who ran from the king’s villa, across the entire city to inform Adis of a declaration of war upon our city state. The messenger informed Adis of his summoning to command the army. “Anaxos, get this man some water! Uliksos, pack your belongings I will be in need of good advice.” Adis commanded upon the slave Anaxos and me. “Yes lord” I answered and swiftly ran to my quarters to pack my belongings.
