<h2>Uriel Sobs</h2>
<p big-letter>
  A choir of divine angels, their wings as white as the very clouds upon which
  they lay. Their robes torn by iron blades. Screams erupt from them as the
  final realization sets in: There is no god, they were created by nothing and
  for no one.
</p>
<p>
  For a millennia they shall scream in longing for a god that does not exist, for
  a god that will not hold or cradle them. Like chicks crying out for a mother
  that will not return to the nest, screaming and crying.
</p>
<p>
  What peace lay there for the humans below the soft clouds. They are alone in
  this cruel universe. They have no god or gods or protectors or guardians. They
  are left alone in this universe with no purpose other than their immediate
  desires.
</p>
<p>
  Arcadia lay in ruins, it's vast forests and ecosystems set alight by reality.
  Azrael soars, finally free to reap souls, while Uriel sobs into his melting
  hands, primordial divinity undone.
</p>

<h2>Concrete</h2>
<p big-letter>
  Long columns of concrete shoot out from the floor into the ceilling, where
  they intersect with the overhead beams of concrete. A structure that will
  hold, serve its purpose. Vast, but unseemly. The concrete is cold and sterile,
  to touch is to feel its bite on you. For a thousand miles it stretches on in
  a thousand different directions: endless
</p>
<p>
  Attempts at warmth do nothing but paint the obscene in vivid colors: The
  columns white and red while the overhead beams are painted a vibrant blue. The
  paint is already peeling even though the uncaring monstrosity that erected
  this insult to human warmth constructed this only a few moons ago.
</p>
<p>
  My eyes dart between the columns, looking for a single other. I am alone in
  the cold. Why walk, I know I shall meet none other. So I sit, the cold
  loneliness I will one day grow accustomed to. Surely one day I shall learn to
  accept its bite, the marks of its teeth upon my body will one day bring
  comfort.
</p>
<p>
  If this maze ever crumbles and I find another, will I miss the cold teeth of
  this brutal concrete, will I struggle to embrace the other. Will the touch of
  another scare me then as the touch of the cold concrete scares me now?
</p>

<h2>I decay</h2>
<p big-letter>
  I've never completed myself. I've never possessed all the parts to make myself
  whole. Limbs have fallen off, decayed. Some I've ripped off because I hated
  them, some I tore off because I heard the voice telling me to rip it off. It
  told me the parts were obscene, they were past their use date. I saw those
  limbs, I looked at them, I saw there to be no issue with them, but still I
  reached, and with wet squelches and the cracking of bone and the awful tearing
  of skin I felt the arm come loose.
</p>
<p no-indent>
  I screamed each time I felt it hit the ground.
</p>
<p no-indent>
  I screamed not from the pain of removal, but from the knowledge I'd lost
  another part of myself, another limb with which I was closer to being whole
  lost.
</p>
<p no-indent>
  Will I ever be whole? Or rather, will I ever feel whole?
</p>
<p no-indent>
  What point is there in tearing my own limbs, hands, legs, eyes from myself? I
  never know, the voice does not spare me the curtesy of explanation, it simply
  demands and explains in demented tongue the benefits.
