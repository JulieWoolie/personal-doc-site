<p no-indent big-letter>
  Surely reality is not the space which I inhabit, surely reality would be more
  exciting, more substantive than this dull existence. I live in a single room
  and while I wish I could claim it was a room with a view of the Seine in
  Paris, or with a view of the Oder, the Rhine or the Elbe in Germany, it isn't.
  My view is of another apartment building and these 2 monitors before me on
  which I type these very letters is my life based on.
</p>
<p>
  There are many a day when I dream of palaces, castles and country estates. How
  wonderous it'd be to live alone in the countryside, near a quaint river in a
  nice little estate with decorated walls, no one to disturb me and no one to be
  disturbed by me. It'd be lovely, I think, although it would merely be my
  current existence with a greater level of wealth.
</p>
<p>
  But of palaces is not all of which I dream. I dream of much, of worlds both
  fantastical and faraway, and of worlds similar to ours but different in slight
  ways. I find these dreams to distract from the miserable dullness of my
  current being. This dreaming has gone to the point where there are many days,
  and many times per day even when I am struck with the realization <i>"This is
  real"</i> and snapped from my dreams. But not always am I fully pulled back
  into reality, a part of me stays in my dreams, in my head, in the worlds I've
  created. They've become my substitute for reality from which I will not be
  pulled from until this reality becomes more worth existing. Never, do I think,
  have I truly wished to be in reality more than in my dreams.
</p>
<p>
  I enjoy, in a way, that sense of not being in reality that so often comes over
  me. Drunkenness, I have found, has made that feeling greater. Some days ago I
  went prancing around outside my little town after having swallowed a good
  number of shots. It was lovely to walk around, to feel detached from all which was
  around me, like none of this truly existed and even in the aspect of control
  of my own body and my vision did everything feel dreamlike. I don't think
  there will be many moments in my life where I'll truly feel that detachment
  from myself again. That pleasant escape, I'll miss it.
</p>
<p>
  I remember having lain by the side of a river among the snow. It's gentle
  stream brushing past. None of it felt real and I laid back, the snow came to
  greet my head, not as gently as I'd liked, but still welcoming in its frosty
  bite. There I laid for a while, enjoying that aforementioned stream. It was
  lovely. What was also lovely was after I'd stumbled to my feet and wandered
  around to the old vodka factory near the river. The building must have
  predated both world wars, judging by its construction style. So even in its
  decrepit state there was a lovely beauty to it that you couldn't find in
  modern construction in the same state of decay.
</p>
<p>
  None of that felt real, and even now as I recall the memories they appear to
  me fuzzy and oddly detached, as if I was witnessing them through the eyes of
  another.
</p>
<p>
  I sometimes write these experiences down and I wonder to myself if
  those I speak to, the everyday person, has already experienced such things,
  such pleasant delirium from drunkenness as I did, or the same feelings of
  detachment and irreality I experience. Sometimes I assume, or maybe delude
  myself to be more accurate, that they are normal feelings all have felt and
  thus there is no purpose in speaking of them or writing of them, lest I appear
  as a fool who has not, at my age, experienced what many have experienced at
  younger ages.
</p>
<p>
  But at the same time, should I deny myself the right of expression simply
  because these feelings have been expressed before, should I not express my
  experience. Is my expression cheapened because of my state of isolation from
  reality, from others, from what I want. Is it? There are a thousand questions
  I wish to ask from someone outside of me, outside my reality, from someone who
  might provide a less biased answer.
</p>

  What was that famous line many quote from Sun Tsu? <i>"If you know the enemy
  and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles."</i>
  While I am not a military-illiterate noble from 6th century BCE China, this
  quote does still apply in the manner that I fear I do not know myself and thus
  can't really exist as a person. There are too many unknowns, too much
  guesswork. I've not been through enough experiences in my life to truly know
  myself. And there lies an issue, the people I know and speak to, I know for
  a fact that although they themselves do not fully know themselves, they've
  experienced, seen and felt enough to know more of themselves than I do. I know
  that to be a fact! Am I misguided in believing this? Perhaps, to an extent.
  There are things I can reliably work out about myself, but with some things I
  must experiment.
</p>
<p>
  For example, I did not know I couldn't drink alcohol while in the company of
  others before I had done so, I could not have worked out that through any
  method of deduction available to me. My original point still stands, I know
  not myself, and for that, I suffer.
</p>
<p>
  I find that often when my mind wanders to thoughts of my own inabilities and
  shortcomings, especially in the department of being able to connect or bond
  with others, I tend to short circuit. My mind's logic runs into a loop, I need
  to develop one skill to be better at doing something, but for that skill to
  develop I need to do that something, and my mind exits this loop by moving on
  to the thought of <i>"I should be put up against a wall and a firing squad
  ordered to end this pathetic mess."</i> A thought process which I believe many
  can agree on being counter-productive.
