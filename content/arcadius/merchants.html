<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  This document describes a system of merchants and tradesmen that richer 
  players can interact with. This sytem allows players to give large quantities
  of items to merchants, who then <i>"embark"</i> on a voyage to sell the goods
  overseas. All funds earned from selling are then returned to the player(s) 
  from whom the items came.
</p>

<h2 no-pre-break>Purpose</h2>
<p>
  The purpose of the merchants is to provide a way for late-game, richer players
  to spend their money and earn more without using farms and mass-selling.
</p>

<h2>Concept</h2>
<p>
  Merchant NPCs set up post where they request a certain amount of stock, always
  in large quantities. Players then give these NPCs stock. And after a certain 
  time, or after their order has been filled, the NPCs <i>embark</i> and

<h2>Regional Differences</h2>
<p>
  Depending on where a player participates in trading, different outcomes are 
  possible.
</p>

<h3>Latium</h3>
<p>
  For players trading in Latium, trade goods are taxed, as such, players will 
  never earn 100% from the goods they trade. There is a <i>minor</i> risk of the
  cargo being taken by pirate's when out at sea. But these ships are protected
  by the Imperial Navy, so the risk is, <i>minor</i>.
</p>
<p>
  The tax rate applied to the goods varies. It is controlled by both the senate
  and the current emperor.
</p>

<h3>Calavera</h3>
<p>
  For players trading in Calavera, trading is more lucrative, as Pirates don't
  pay taxes. But the risk of the shipments being seized by the Imperial Navy is
  greater.
</p>
<p>
  To combat this, players can pay a <i>Protection Fee</i> for armored ships to 
  accompany their ships and keep them safe from the imperial fleet.
</p>
<p>
  In Calavera, it will also matter which merchants you trade with. This is 
  because some merchants will have a tendency to scam you. Take your goods, 
  maybe even your protection fee, and run, never to return.
