ArcadiusMC was a project between me, and two of my friends to make a server 
focused on 3 factions with loads of features.

The project came to an end when we decided that working on the server was 
becoming more like a 2nd job than something we enjoyed doing.

Now, ArcadiusMC is just the name of the organization on GitHub I write my 
Minecraft-related code under.
