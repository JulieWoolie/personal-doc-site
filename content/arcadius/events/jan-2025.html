<h2>General Concept</h2>
<p>
  The general concept of the event is to escape from many Ravagers chasing the 
  player. The player is spawned at the edge of a hill, atop which lies several 
  targets the player must break with snow balls.
</p>
<p>
  The player acquires these snow balls by wondering around the hill and dodging
  Ravagers. Once enough snowballs have been gotten, the player is able to break
  all targets at the top of the hill and the event ends.
</p>

<h2>Event Arena</h2>
<p>
  As described before, the main arena of the event is a snowy hill, with 
  Ravagers. The hill is broken into corridors with cliffs, some connected by 
  arch ways. At the top of this hill is a clearing with a circular sturcture 
  which contains the targets the player must hit in order to end the event.
</p>

<h2>Extras</h2>
<p>This section describes extra, but optional, features for the event.</p>

<h3>Item Shop</h3>
<p>
  A shop that accepts an event-only currency, or gems, in exchange for rare 
  items. One of the items, if possible, should be an Event Card, a map item that
  features custom art as a keepsake for the event. This card should be a one-time
  purchase.
</p>

<h3>Money Drops</h3>
<p>
  Along side the snow balls there could also be small piles of gold litered 
  around the arena that players can pick up. These gold piles would obiously
  reward Denarii.
</p>

<h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
<p>
  A player's entry exists as a state machine in one of the following states:
  <ul>
    <li><code>INACTIVE</code></li>
    <li><code>STARTING</code></li>
    <li><code>PLAY</code></li>
  </ul>
  This section defines the states and how they are changed and what happens
  during each state.
</p>
<p>
  When a player enters the event, their event entry is set to an 
  <code>STARTING</code> state.
</p>

<h3><code>STARTING</code> State</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>When Entering State</dt>
  <dd>
    The player is teleported into the arena, and all the Ravagers are spawned as 
    well. Neither the player nor the Ravagers are allowed to move at this point.
    But the player is allowed to look around, but not pick up any coin stacks or
    other items. Other objects such as the snowballs, coin stacks and anything 
    else are spawned at this point.
  </dd>

  <dt>During State</dt>
  <dd>
    The player is displayed a countdown each second, from 5 to 1. 1 being 
    replaced with <i>"Go!"</i>. After the countdown ends, the state transitions
    to the next state.
  </dd>

  <dt>Exiting State</dt>
  <dd>
    This state always transitions to the <code>PLAY</code> State after the 
    countdown ends, unless the player manually exits the event, then it 
    transitions to the <code>INACTIVE</code> state.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h3><code>PLAY</code> State</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>When Entering State</dt>
  <dd>
    The player and all the Ravagers are allowed to move, coins can be interacted
    with, and items can be picked up. The entry's starting time is set to the 
    current timestamp.
  </dd>

  <dt>During State</dt>
  <dd>
    A timer is shown on the player's screen indicating how much time they've
    spent in the event. The value of the timer displayed on the screen, is 
    always the difference between the current time and entry's starting time.
  </dd>

  <dt>Exiting State</dt>
  <dd>
    Can only be done manually by the player, or when the player destroys all
    targets in the middle of the arena. If all targets are destroyed, then the 
    event is exited in a completed way, otherwise the player simply exits.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h3><code>INACTIVE</code> State</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>When Entering State</dt>
  <dd>
    All Ravagers in the event are removed, coin stacks, removed, dropped items
    removed and the center of the arena is repaired.
    <p>
      If the player exited successfully, then compare the player's current score
      to their record. If the score is lower than the record, set the record to 
      be the score. Else do nothing.
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt>During State</dt>
  <dd>Nothing, State declares end of entry's participation.</dd>
  <dt>Exiting State</dt>
  <dd>State cannot be exited.</dd>
</dl>
