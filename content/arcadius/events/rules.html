<h2>Event Rules</h2>
<p>The following checks must be passed during testing for an event to be considered in &#39;acceptable&#39; conditions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Dying in the event must remove you from the event instantly and nullify any potential score gain, as well as remove any event-provided items and/or effects.</li>
<li>Quitting in the event must do the same as above.</li>
<li>It should be impossible to enter the event with potion effects, they must be either:<ul>
<li>Cleared upon entering</li>
<li>Prevented from entering if they possess potion effects</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Entering the event should function perfectly each time</li>
<li>Exiting the event should function perfectly each time</li>
<li>Completing the event, different from exiting, should follow the event&#39;s context and assign scores only if:<ul>
<li>The player&#39;s score is higher than their record</li>
<li>The event uses the assign-only-if-score-greater rule</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Alt accounts are not permitted to gain score on the same ground as main accounts, when dealing with an alt, one of the following methods must be used<ul>
<li>The alt is unable to enter (preferred)</li>
<li>The alt is unable to gain score</li>
<li>The alt&#39;s score is given to the main</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The follwing are optional checks which apply on a per-event basis:</p>
<ol>
<li>Entering the event with items in your inventory shouldn&#39;t be possible, it should be checked. An event may never remove items from, or clear, your inventory, unless the items were given by the event</li>
</ol>
<p>If the event uses an &#39;arena&#39; which is built either by generation or example-pasting the following should be checked:</p>
<ol>
<li>The arena generates correctly,</li>
<li>All triggers within the arena function correctly</li>
<li>Any and all spawned or moved entities be placed correclty</li>
<li>Any and all spawned or moved entities function correclty</li>
<li>If the arena features a &#39;tick list&#39; then the following must be check:<ul>
<li>Each tick-list-entry is ticked correctly and at correct intervals</li>
<li>Any exception thrown by an entry does not stop the tick&#39;s execution</li>
<li>Any exception thrown by an entry is logged in console</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Events must block the following commands:
<code>tpa, tpask, tpahere, tpaskhere, tpdeny, tpcancel, tpaccept, home, echest, ec, enderchest, wb, workbench, kit, back, workb, warp</code></p>
<h2 id="project-rules">Project rules</h2>
<p>Any project for a Succession Event must - from here on out - follow the following naming principle: 
<code>{MONTH}-{YEAR}-{NAME}Event</code> An example would be <code>April-2022-PrankEvent</code></p>
