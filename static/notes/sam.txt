Hey,

A lot of the stuff I wrote for Kadence, also applies to you, in a strange way.
Were it not for you, I most likely would've tried again to end my life not soon
after my first attempt years ago.

I think about you in a strange way, on one hand, I'm immensely happy you're my
friend, and I love you as a friend. I love spending time with you, hanging out
together. I treasure the time moments we've had together. I always loved playing
Genshin with you, it was wonderful, even though that infernal game always burned
me out. I sometimes still think about the times you invited me out to places,
they weren't the best experiences, but I'm still glad you brought me.

But on the other hand, I feel a seething jealousy over the fact I've seen you do
what I couldn't: Develop and grow as a person, change. I hate you for being able
to always have friends, people by your side, been able to do the things I only
ever was able to dream of. I saw you as an example of what I could've been like
had I not failed, everytime.

While my plan was to hang myself still, I came up with this cruel idea of how
I'd tell you I was ending it. I was going to put the noose up, and right before
ending it, take a snap of it and send it to you with the caption "Au revoir." No
note, no explanation, just a fuck you. I don't know how cruel that is compared
to this. Mostly I thought you wouldn't care if I went, so I wanted to make it
hurt.

I hate you, and I love you. Please forget I ever existed.

Your truly,
Julie
