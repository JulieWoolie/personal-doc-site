palace. The mountain is so inhospitable that any mortal who encroaches upon
the gods will die. No amount of clothes or magic will keep anyone safe.
However there have been a select few that have visited the Gods. One notable
person to be allowed to visit the gods was the First Emperor Adis, who after
death became king of the gods and his body was taken by the gods to Hadria
and resurrected.</p><p>The gods were the first humans to exist and founded the world. Not wanting to
be disturbed they created the Hadria mountain range. The gods made a promise
to create humanity and not disturb it for 2000 years. For those 2000 years
they looked on in horror, but also they accepted what humans had become. Even
after the 2000 years had ended, the gods did not interfear.</p><p>In the first temple ever built, The Temple of the six there is an orb made of
magic, if this were to go out the Seal between Horandia and the Human plane
would be destroyed. The fire can be kept by either 6 Priests who have devoted
their entire life and have had their chasitidy Secured by the removel of their
genitals. Or it can be kept by Emperors of Divine Blood (Sucsessors of Adis)</p><p>The First Gods lived with the Evil Gods. But when the Gods created humans, the
Evil gods started stealing from and killing the humans. What finally made the
Good Gods snap was the Murder of 12,560 citizens in the Bian Region. The gods
intervened and tried to banish them to Horandia.The Evil gods Resisted and
fought with the Gods. Their battle resulted in the total destuction of
South-East Bian Region, creating theBian Plains. The Gods were victorious and
the Evil Gods Were banished to Horandia.</p><p>The only person to ever make it to the gods without their summon was Alexius
Karlius Vexium the worlds best gladiator. He fought for 23 years and as a gift
the emperor allowed him to go free. After his visit of the Gods he is belived
to have been made Protector of the Gods. an immortal being to Protect the
Gods, forever standing guard at the Gate.</p><p>The Gods have also imposed limitations upon themselves, on of these is that
they can be killed. For the gods belive that if anyone makes it to them with
hostile intention, they should be allowed to excecute their wish.</p><p>The Gods do not need to eat. Sometimes they eat for the taste.</p><p>Natural Children of the gods do exist, but there are only 3 left alive.</p><p>At this current time the gods have taken a wow of non interfearance.</p></div><script src=/js/images.js></script></div><script src=/js/main.js></script>
