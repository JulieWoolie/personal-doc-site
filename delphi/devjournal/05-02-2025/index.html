completely functional with auto margins and stuff.</p><p>I started by adding support the <code>box-sizing</code> property to Chimera
and NLayout.</p><figure id=offsetbug><img src=/delphi/bug-off-to-right.png><figcaption>The offset bug I described yesterday. The blue is where the black
background is intended to be located. The item element (pickaxe) is also
wildly offset from where it is intended to be. Another bug to fix...</figcaption></figure><figure id=nobg><img src=/delphi/bug-nobg.png><figcaption>On top of the previous bug, when a page is spawned, the backgrounds, outlines
and anything other than content is blank, resulting in this. To force the
background to render I need to trigger a visual update, which can be done by
looking at the Item element, as its tooltip appearing causes a render update
of the DOM tree... for some reason.</figcaption></figure><p>Fixing the second bug <figref fig=nobg></figref> was easy. It turns out I
wasn't calling the function that set the background element's content to
<code>"0"</code> and opacity to 24 when initially spawning the element.</p><h2>Nightmares...</h2><p>The first part of this log was written 29-01-2025. This part is written on
the 5th of February...</p><p>After a week or even more, after rewriting the whole renderer... The error is
that the <code>0</code> char is not centered in the Display entity. It's
offset.</p><p>If I haven't already, I'll define the term <i>"Empty Text Display Block"</i>,
it is a text display, with content <code>"0"</code>, set to a scale of
<code>x=5.714286 y=4.0</code>. This means that '0' (along with the 1 pixel of
padding the entity is given) is scaled up to the size of a single block. At
that scale, the origin point of the entity is offset from its actual visual
center by <code>0.0625</code>.</p><p>This offset from the center is what caused the first bug:
<figref fig=offsetbug></figref>. And to fix it, I came up with this simple
function:<pre><code>
    EMPTY_TD_BLOCK_SIZE_X = 1.0 / (0.025 * 7.0)
    BLOCK_OFFSET_X =  0.0625
    <i>f</i>(x) = (x / EMPTY_TD_BLOCK_SIZE_X) * BLOCK_OFFSET_X
  </code></pre>Where <code>x</code> is the current X-scale of the display entity.</p><p>With this fixed, I now need to re-add support for the
<code>GLOBAL_SCALAR</code> constant, which I removed as I thought it was
interfering with stuff.</p><p>Hour later, and that's done.</p><figure id=afterworking><img src=/delphi/endof-05-02-2025.png><figcaption>The <code>test:index.xml</code> menu after bug fixes.</figcaption></figure><p>Now, the immediate remaining issues:<ul><li>ItemStacks are too far from the menu surface</li><li>Tooltip is underneath its item, most likely related to the above issue</li><li>Scale doesn't correctly apply to item stack render objects.<br>By this, I mean that when you have an <code>&lt;item/></code>
element, changing its width (for eg: <code>&lt;item style="width: 10px; height: 64px;" /></code>)
should change the item's size as well, but at the moment, it just
changes <code>ItemRenderObject</code>'s <code>ElementRenderObject</code>
parent size.<br>Fix by calculating item entity scalar with the parent size, if available.</li><li>Screen projection is disabled.<note idx=0></note></li></ul></p><p>I realized the constant that offsets the item entity was missing a
<code>GLOBAL_SCALAR</code> multiply, and now it's an acceptable distance from
the screen. And I also realized I'd forgotten to support the
<code>z-index</code> style property, which I quickly fixed. And with that,
the first 2 remaining issues are fixed.</p><figure><img src=/delphi/funny-scaled-item.png><figcaption>Item scaling fixed, demonstrated by an item with funny dimensions (32px x 10px)</figcaption></figure><figure><img src=/delphi/working-projections.png><figcaption>And after uncommenting some code, projection is back as well.</figcaption></figure><h2>Afterword</h2><p>Oh my god... That was a nightmare. I couldn't figure out why the offset bug
was happening, I was convinced my math was wrong and that my data structure
was so terribly set up I couldn't catch it, so I rewrote the renderer's data
structure.</p><p>Took me an actual week to figure out the 0 character center offset was the
issue.</p><p>Now, as for the future. I might try to set up something to automatically test
layouts (element sizes and positions). But if that becomes too cumbersome (or
I just don't feel like it), I'll focus on the Layout system by itself.</p><p>For the layout, I'll first need to make sure that measurement pass over the
render tree functions correctly. I know it doesn't because I just don't vibe
with the measurement function. (I also haven't tested it beyond the above
shown screenshot <figref fig=afterworking></figref>)</p><hr latex-ignore class=notes-hr><h2 latex-ignore class=notesheader>Notes</h2><ol latex-ignore id=footnotes-list><li note-idx=0>Screen projection is the process of scaling and rotating render objects to be inline with the screen&rsquo;s normal and size.</li></ol></div><script src=/js/images.js></script></div><div class="bg-dark content-sizing footer" style=margin-top:2cm><div class=footer-flex><button class=button id=latex-convert-btn>Copy content as LaTeX</button>
