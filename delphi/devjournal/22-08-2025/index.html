I finally got around to implementing FlexBox. It took me chugging
an entire pitcher of black coffee <i>(Don't judge me, I like doing that.)</i>
Granted, it's not fully functional, or maybe it is, I don't know, my unit
tests are comprehensive enough to say yet.</p><p>To accomplish this, I knew I'd need to layout algorithm in a place that didn't
require me to have a server running, so I moved all the layout code into its
own module, named <code>nlayout</code>. And instead of it meaning
<i>"New Layout"</i>, the name now means <i>"Narcissine Layout Engine"</i>,
because to believe I can competently mimic web layout standards has got to be
narcissistic.</p><p>When I transferred all the code over to the new module, I ditched whatever
the hell code structure I had before and instead adopted a tree structure made
out of <code>LayoutNode</code>s and <code>LayoutBox</code>es. I had to do a
quick bit of messing around with the Flow algorithm's previous implementation
to get it to adapt.</p><p>But it worked, then, I implemented FlexBox. I had written pieces of the
algorithm beforehand, adding a couple lines once a week here and there. But
now, loaded up on a literal pitcher of black coffee, I wrote the entire
algorithm in one afternoon and IT RAN, I AM THE GOAT</p><p>It worked in game as well, as you can see here:</p><iframe style=width:100%;height:300px src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-7bjVY7K57k?si=CNrUqhdkLucniMnh" title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy=strict-origin-when-cross-origin allowfullscreen></iframe><h2>Major hiccups</h2><p>I soon however encountered an issue. I attempted to open the <i>"Meta"</i>
page on Devtools, just to see if it rendered correctly. The server soon
crashed because my ported-over Flow algorithm began looping infinitely. At
this point it was late and I went to sleep.</p><p>The next day, after an hour or two of wrangling I managed to recreate the
circumstance of the infinite loop in a Layout test file. It turns out the
issue was caused by a <code>width: auto;</code> element having a
<code>width: 100%</code> element as a child. During first time layout, the
auto element's size is set to the screen's size, and then, after its child
element's sizes are measured, the size of the auto element is adjusted.</p><p>The issue with this, is that the child element's size is set to the screen's
size, then the parent element grows to adapt, then during the next measurement
stabilization run, the child element grows again, and this repeats until the
server stalls and crashes.</p><p>It took me an entire day to figure out how to handle and prevent this. I have
to thank the W3C standards for coming in clutch, after about 8 hours I busted
open the specs and found this section:
<a href=https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/#cyclic-percentage-contribution target=_blank>Intrinsic Contributions of Percentage-Sized Boxes
</a>.
Of course, just handle the percent values as <code>auto</code> if the
parent's size isn't explicitly set. I don't know why or how, but yeah... this
fixed it.</p><h2>Thoughts</h2><p>When I initially started writing the layout engine, I felt like I was in the
dark, I didn't know what I was doing and everything I read either in the spec
or from other people's own implementations or guides seemed to confuse me
more.</p><p>One big thing that confused me was how you can perform layout without knowing
the state of everything, the parent size may be auto, but the size you're
trying to figure out is percentage based. How do you operate in that area of
uncertainty?</p><p>Now though, I just write the layout code with the assumption of <i>"I know
everything about the state of the layout at this moment :)"</i> And it works,
and I'm much more familiar with the concepts and algorithms.</p><p>That being said, I still have a ways to go, Delphi at the moment does not
support any kind of writing system other than left-to-write. I assume this
already means this plugin cannot be used for languages like Arabic, which
write right-to-left, or Japanese, which can be either left-to-right or
vertical.</p><p>I wouldn't even know where to start with those languages, I only speak my own
native language and English.</p><h2>Other stuff</h2><p>I also updated the <a href=/delphi/layout>NLayout</a> documentation itself
to reflect the new engine.</p><p>If you want to get the latest version of the plugin (at time of writing), the
download link is
<a href=https://modrinth.com/plugin/delphi/version/0.5.0 target=_blank>here (Modrinth)!</a></p><h2>Future stuff</h2><p>I'm starting to feel the plugin is almost at a stage where I can call it
ready for release. <i>(That's a lie.)</i></p><p>I want to implement 2 more major features before it: Positioned Layout, and
non-module based menus.</p><h3>Positioned Layout</h3><p>It feels like such a vital part for menus, that final touch, on top of Flow
and Flexbox. Being able to position elements as you want on the page without
it really affecting the current layout engine feels crucial for any release
version of this plugin.</p><p>That being said. When it came to Flexbox and Flow, I started out with some
knowledge of how they worked and their basics. I know almost nothing about
Positioned layout. I've rarely used it, but each time I have used it, it has
been powerful and provided features Flow and Flex cannot.</p><h3>Non-module based menus</h3><p>Currently, in order to create a menu, even programmatically, you need to
register either a <code>IoModule</code> or a <code>ApiModule</code> that
opens menus from a provided <code>ResourcePath</code>.</p><p>This system feels cumbersome and sometimes like it could get in the way. The
big <b>+</b> it provides however, is the ability to open a menu anywhere, as
long as you know the command, path and any optional query params that the
menu might require. In fact, that's how I opened the Devtools before I added
the <code>/delphi devtools</code> command. I used <code>/delphi open @s devtools?:target=delphi-page-0</code>.
It's a bit cumbersome, but I could it anywhere and for whatever page.</p><p>The reason I feel non-module based should be added is because I think it'll
be easier for developers to work with. If you can just create a
<code>Document</code> anywhere and just open it, no need for a registered
<code>Module</code> instance.</p><p>For now, as well, I think the creation of non-module based menus, or rather,
pure programmatic menus would only be possible only through the Delphi
plugin's API.</p></article><script src=/js/images.js></script></main><div class="bg-dark content-sizing footer" style=margin-top:2cm><div class=footer-flex><button class=button id=latex-convert-btn>Copy content as LaTeX</button>
