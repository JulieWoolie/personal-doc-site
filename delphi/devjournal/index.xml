I started finally implementing the renderer I created in the delphirender module. Starting with a very simple Flow layout that just places elements after each other. I'll implement the rest of the layout once I know the configuration and projection of entities is correct. Afterword It's 7 hours later. I hate this project... I spent almost all of today thinking about and fixing issues related to the most simple parts of rendering and layout possible.</description></item></channel></rss>
