I started finally implementing the renderer I created in the delphirender module. Starting with a very simple Flow layout that just places elements after each other. I'll implement the rest of the layout once I know the configuration and projection of entities is correct. Afterword It's 7 hours later. I hate this project... I spent almost all of today thinking about and fixing issues related to the most simple parts of rendering and layout possible.</description></item><item><title>05-02-2025</title><link>https://example.org/delphi/devjournal/05-02-2025/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.org/delphi/devjournal/05-02-2025/</guid><description>Today I'll most likely be fixing yesterday's bugs, getting the Flow layout completely functional with auto margins and stuff. I started by adding support the box-sizing property to Chimera and NLayout. The offset bug I described yesterday. The blue is where the black background is intended to be located. The item element (pickaxe) is also wildly offset from where it is intended to be. Another bug to fix... On top of the previous bug, when a page is spawned, the backgrounds, outlines and anything other than content is blank, resulting in this.</description></item></channel></rss>
