about how this plugin is going. Been busy <i>(with everything except working
on the damned flexbox support)</i>.</p><h2>Canvas elements!</h2><p>Canvas elements are basically images, that you can draw whatever you want on
to. I thought these would be good for people wanting to implement more complex
features for their menus, and would also be cool for potential providing a
basis for an <code>&lt;img></code> element in the future.</p><p>Now, basically, a canvas element is an array of pixels. You can configure the
size of the canvas with the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>
attributes. These will change the pixel resolution of the canvas, but if you
override the <code>width</code> or <code>height</code> CSS properties, then
the canvas will use that for it's size (pixel resolution will not change,
pixels will just have different sizes than normal)</p><p>With it just being an array of pixels there comes an issue, however. A 16x16
image is 256 pixels. How can you draw 256 different pixels with just Display
Entities? Well, you use a separate display entity for each pixel. This
obviously presents a problem, how the hell do you render any canvas with a
significant size without using literally thousands of entities?</p><h3>Greedy Meshing pixels... or whatever you call this</h3><p>In order to minimize the amount of entities used, we need group pixels of the
same color value into one entity when possible. To do this, I implemented
what I think is called a greedy mesher? I've only seen that applied to voxels,
so I don't know what the correct term is.</p><p>The algorithm is really simple <i>(See algorithm <a href=https://github.com/JulieWoolie/delphi/blob/main/render/src/main/java/com/juliewoolie/delphirender/object/CanvasRenderObject.java#L188 target=_blank>here</a>.)</i>
It works by iterating over each pixel, and then expanding horizontally until
it encounters a pixel with a different value, then it tries to expand
vertically. If it managed to expand in any direction, the grouped size is a
mesh! If not, who cares, move on.</p><p>This grouping can help save on the amount of entities used, especially for
images where lots of repetitive colors are used, like, a color selection
thing, which is exactly what I used as a test bench for canvases:</p><iframe style=width:100%;height:300px src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/he3oTKRLJo8?si=_InmhytwFPZn_zfP" title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy=strict-origin-when-cross-origin allowfullscreen></iframe>
<i>(Note that the video was made before the pixel grouping was implemented, so
the entity count of 3997 has since been cut down a lot.)</i><p>You may also notice a bit of a flicker between the pixels of the canvas, I
have since fixed this by implementing the absolutely genius solution of just
increasing the size of the pixels by a very tiny amount so they overlap.</p><h3>Other Canvas features</h3><p>I also added support for the alpha channel, so you can have parts of the
canvas with opacity, or just straight up not be visible.</p><h2>Moving from Arcadius to my personal account</h2><p>Yeah, ArcadiusMC, that server I tried to set up with my friends, failed
miserably around a year ago now. And I decided that it's not worth it keeping
things on the ArcadiusMC domain or packages, as such, I've moved over a lot
of things to my own personal GitHub account.</p><h2>A new scripting library!</h2><p>I'm writing a scripting library for PaperMC, and I've moved a lot of the
annotation-based script interop system over to that. For now, the repository
for that project is private while I work on getting it to a usable state.</p><p>And of course, continuing in my fangirling of Ancient Greek things, the
library will be called <i>"Hephaestus"</i>.</p><h2>A new XML parser!</h2><p>I moved from the default SAX parser implemention to TagSoup's SAX XML Parser.
This was because I wanted a more lax parser (And also because I wanted
attributes without needing to specify a value for them).</p><h2>Other small things</h2><ul><li>Fixed plugin messages being broken after I switched to using the
MiniMessage Translator</li><li>Fixed a visual error that happened when changing an element's text content.
<i>(This was fixed by forcing a re-render of the DOM, instead of just
re-rerendering one entity. This worked because the method call I replaced
was right after a <code>triggerRealign</code> call, the realignment is
applied later, so it's better to also respawn the element later)</i></li><li>Fixed a dumb issue that originates from me trying to prevent unnecessary
array construction when calling event listeners.</li><li>Add support for the <code>defer</code> attribute on script elements</li><li>Fix another stupid mistake that existed because I didn't test anything in
the API module.
<i>(Calling <code>Color.hsv</code> would always return black)</i></li><li>Update to 1.21.7</li><li>Fixed an issue where background colors on elements didn't change correctly.</li><li>Created an official logo for the project :D
<i>(It's an edited version of the HTML5 Logo)</i></li><li>Added <code>/delphi devtools</code> for opening devtools for the menu
you're currently looking at and
<code>/delphi devtools &lt;instance name></code> for opening devtools
for a specific page.</li></ul><h2>Future plans</h2><p>At present, I feel like I should focus on getting a better layout system set
up, fix up the issues with the Flow layout and then implement FlexBox layout.</p><p>But good lord, reading the FlexBox W3C Specification is nigh on impossible,
it's so verbose and unreadable. Luckily I have another website that speaks
about the FlexBox algorithm more clearly <a href=https://www.quirksmode.org/css/flexbox-algorithm.html target=_blank>here</a>.</p><p>Besides the layout and rendering side, I'd also like to focus on finishing
the devtools and making it possible to debug and screw around with page
elements using it. <i>(Maybe integrate a web based version that lets you see
the Delphi XML code in a browser and apply changes in game when you make
changes in the browser)</i></p></article><script src=/js/images.js></script></main><div class="bg-dark content-sizing footer" style=margin-top:2cm><div class=footer-flex><button class=button id=latex-convert-btn>Copy content as LaTeX</button>
