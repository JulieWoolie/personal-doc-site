way.</p><p>But alas, I've reworked some stuff and added support for
<code>&lt;input/></code> elements. I had some issues implementing these
elements and confusion conceptually, mentioned below.</p><h2>Going public</h2><p>I finally went "public" with this project, meaning I posted it on HangarMC and
made the repository public and posted about it to the PaperMC Discord.</p><p>So the project's finally open source. Let's see what that brings.</p><h2>Input elements</h2><p>If you've used the <code>&lt;input></code> HTML elements, you know what I
wanted to get out of these. But in case you don't, this is an HTML input
element:</p><input type=text placeholder="Enter text..."><p>Basically, it lets you input text that the page can use somehow. The above
shown input is styled the same way as it is styled by default in Delphi.</p><p>Before making an input element, I had to come up with how the element would
take input from the player. The first and easiest solution I came up with was
to use Bukkit's <code>Conversation</code> API. But, that has an issue, it
takes all chat input as conversation input. Which is perfect, but you can't
provide custom suggestions for non-command chat as dynamically as you can for
commands.</p><p>So I had an idea, use a command like <code>/delphi-input &lt;input></code>
to access take input and also provide suggestions. When a player clicks on the
input element, they're placed into a map, with a timeout of a minute or so.
When the player inputs that command, it can fetch the element they're
inputting to and get appropriate suggestions or anything. With this, the text
in the element could change dynamically with each call to the tab completion
method.</p><p>I ultimately decided against the command solution because using the
Conversation API was easier, faster and felt it made more sense, you open chat
and type in the input.</p><p>If I decide the other method to be better, I might refactor in the future.</p><p>After some small changes to the render system, a new event and some other
minor additions, the input element was fully supported. In the end, it uses
a global listener to listen for clicks on input elements, which then uses a
Bukkit Conversation to listen for input from the player.</p><p>What's left?</p><ul><li>Handle the <code>active</code> state of the input element differently. While
the element is waiting for input it should be considered
<code>active</code>.</li><li>While <code>active</code>, it should prevent multiple players from trying to
input into the same element at once.</li><li>Support for the <code>prompt</code> attribute that the Bukkit Conversation
will use when prompting the player for input.</li></ul><h2>DevTools</h2><p>If you've ever worked on frontend design on the web, or just right-clicked
and clicked on <i>"Inspect Element"</i>, you've used your browser's devtools.
Devtools show you an overview of the HTML and effective CSS of elements among
many other things. It is an amazing tool for debugging and working with web
design. So it makes sense that Delphi should have something similar.</p><p>As of writing this post, the devtools only shows the XML layout of a Delphi
page and nothing more. But I'm hoping to add the following:</p><ul><li>A <i>"Devtool Stick"</i> that, when used to right click on an element,
opens the devtools window.</li><li>An overlay that shows the padding box, border box, outline box and margin
box of an element when hovered over with a devtool stick or when the
corresponding element's XML is hovered over in the devtools window.</li><li>A css explorer <i>(Or whatever it's called)</i> for selecting an element in
the XML tree and then inspecting its effective CSS rules and inline style.</li><li>A document info tab that shows you metadata about a page, along with a few
buttons (such as the debug XML dump)</li><li>Inspect element interactivity. This means clicking on elements to get a
dropdown to remove it, change the tag name, add/remove attributes or other
things, clicking on attribute values to edit them, clicking on the name to
rename, or remove it, etc. The CSS for these things is kinda already set up,
with hover colors to indicate things can be interacted with, but the logic
itself isn't implemented yet.<p>This will require a future technology: Drop downs or just context menus
that appear when you right click select elements.</p></li></ul><p>I added support for a new type of module, as well: Hidden modules. These will
be internal modules at the moment. I basically only added this so I could
support the devtools module without it being visible to anyone typing in the
command.</p><h2>Misc. Changes</h2><p>I moved the logic that handles <code>&lt;java-object></code> element logic
to a System<note idx=0></note> instead of performing the logic inside the
element class itself.</p><p>The ID system itself was also moved to its own System<note idx=0></note>,
which for a couple hours caused me strife because I used a
<code>getTarget</code> instead of <code>getNode</code> when listening to
mutation events.</p><hr latex-ignore class=notes-hr><h2 latex-ignore class=notesheader>Notes</h2><ol latex-ignore id=footnotes-list><li note-idx=0>Think of XML nodes and elements as components/entities in an ECS. Systems are like the Systems of entity component systems. They handle the logic of the elements, which themselves are just data</li></ol></div><script src=/js/images.js></script></div><div class="bg-dark content-sizing footer" style=margin-top:2cm><div class=footer-flex><button class=button id=latex-convert-btn>Copy content as LaTeX</button>
