Hello,

I'm sorry to let you know like this, but I will be ending it. I'm going to a
nice forest near me, it'll be cold, very cold, but I kinda like that. And it
won't matter either way.

I loved you a lot, you meant a lot to me. I'm sorry, for becoming who I did at
the end, for saying horrible things to you, for everything. You are most likely
the sole reason I did live as long as I did.

I had so much fun with you, I enjoyed spending time with you, talking to you,
being with you. Our distance, however, was the fatal flaw in it all. The one
thing you could never help with was that which I lacked in reality, other
people, physically. People to hug, to be near. I don't think I've ever made a
joke to a bunch of people and seen their faces light up with laughter.

It feels sad, going out having never held a lover's hand, kissed a friend's or
lovers cheeks, never kissed anyone's lips, having never lain in bed with another
so close to me. Luxuries I was never able to afford. My entire life has felt
like one crooked or missed experience after another.

You made all of that pain so much more bearable though, but it was never meant
to be, I'm sorry.

Yours truly,
Julie
