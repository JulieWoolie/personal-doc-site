Hi,

I'm sorry for this, but my story unfortunately ends today.

I owe a lot to you, I learned to code, I got really into it because of you, I
think some of the biggest things I ever made were because in 2020 you helped me
write a Java plugin, as annoying as I was back then.

I hope this new FTC succeeds, I hope it does better than the previous server
did. I wish I could give some words of wisdom to you with it, but honestly, if
anyone here needs advice on running a server, it'd be me. You're great at it.

5 years, that's how long I've known you, at least in some capacity. And it's
been a great time. I'm sorry that I'm leaving like this, but I don't want to
fail anymore. That's what the previous 5 years have felt like outside of
Minecraft, outside of coding. I've watched the people around me grow up, become
adults, while I've failed to do any of that, and I don't want to keep going.

Good luck with ServerWars, I'll miss you.

Yours truly,
Julie
